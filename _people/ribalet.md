**Research Scientist**  

My research focuses on the role microbes play in marine ecosystems. As a marine ecologist, I study how microbial communities influence the health and stability of our oceans across scales, from the microscopic level to entire ocean basins. 
My approach is quantitative and interdisciplinary, combining mathematical modeling and statistical analysis to understand these processes and predict changes in the marine carbon cycle.
To test my models, I also conduct fieldwork, collecting data with our [SeaFlow cytometer](https://seaflow.netlify.app/).
