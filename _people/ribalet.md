**Research Scientist**  

My research focuses on understanding the dynamics of marine ecosystems and the impact of biological processes on nutrients and element cycling in the ocean. I specialize in studying the structure and interactions of microbial communities, including viruses, bacteria, phytoplankton, and grazers. These microorganisms play a crucial role in regulating the Earth's climate by fixing carbon dioxide, generating biomass, recycling nutrients, and forming the foundation of the marine food web. To study these microorganisms, I leverage laboratory experiments, field observations, and satellite data to develop mathematical models that forecast microbial interactions across a range of ocean conditions.
