**Research Scientist**  

My research focuses on understanding the dynamics of marine ecosystems and the impact of biological processes on the carbon cycle. 
I specialize in the study of microbial community structure and interactions, which includes viruses, bacteria, phytoplankton, and grazers. 
These microorganisms play a crucial role in regulating the Earth's climate by fixing carbon dioxide, generating biomass, recycling nutrients, and forming the foundation of the marine food web. 
I develop mathematical and data-driven models guided by lab experiments and field observations to explore how these organisms interact  and regulate carbon fluxes in marine ecosystems.
