**Research Scientist**  

My research focuses on developing a mechanistic understanding of marine ecosystem dynamics and the influence of biological activities on carbon cycling. 
As a marine ecologist, I specialize in studying microbial communities, including viruses, bacteria, phytoplankton, and grazers, in a wide range of marine environments. 
My approach is both quantitative and interdisciplinary, involving  mathematical and simulation modeling, and statistical analysis of complex data sets. I conduct field work and collect data - particularity using [SeaFlow](https://seaflow.netlify.app/), a shipboard underway flow cytometer - to explore how these organisms interact with their environment and regulate carbon fluxes in the surface ocean.
