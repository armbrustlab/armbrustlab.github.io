**Research Scientist**  
As a microbial ecologist, I study the mechanisms that shape the distribution of marine microbes across scales, from the microscopic level to entire ocean basins. My approach is quantitative and interdisciplinary, combining mathematical modeling and statistical analysis to understand these processes and build predictive models of how microbes may respond to future ocean conditions. To test these models, I conduct fieldwork and collect extensive data with our [SeaFlow cytometer](https://seaflow.netlify.app/).
