Mohammad Ashkezari
Research Scientist

I am a PhD in Physics with a background in scientific computing and numerical calculations. With the rapid growth in heterogeneous scientific data, the need for developing software tools that can simplify the process of conducting multi-disciplinary data analyses is more pronounced than ever. During the past few years, I have been focused on the Simons CMAP project; a database of harmonized marine datasets optimized for integrating non-cooperating data sources.

Academia:

Research Scientist: UW 2017
Postdoc: MIT 2014-2017
PhD Physics: SFU / CERN 2009-2014
