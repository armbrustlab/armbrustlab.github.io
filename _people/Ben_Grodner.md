About Me
As part of the Armbrust lab, I am researching the spatial variability of microbial strategies for iron acquisition in open ocean communities. Previously, as a PhD student in biomedical engineering at Cornell University in Ithaca, I developed imaging techniques for mapping multispecies microbial biofilms, especially dental plaques. I received a B.S. in biological engineering from Montana State University in Bozeman, where I studied the transport of pathogens from surfaces via splash droplets. In my free time I enjoy running long distances and playing bass in bluegrass and rock bands.
