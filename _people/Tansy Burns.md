## Research Scientist

---
I am the research coordinator for Simons-CMAP (www.simonscmap.com), a collection of harmonized data and open-source tools developed to investigate the hidden worlds of ocean microbes.  I coordinate work and planning within the Simons-CMAP group, and I am also the point of contact for collaborators and Simons-CMAP users.  My career has spanned ocean research, program/project management, and education, and I most enjoy working where these areas intersect.
