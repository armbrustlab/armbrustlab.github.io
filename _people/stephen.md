## About Me

As a part of the Armbrust lab, I am working on developing computational tools for the discovery and characterization of molecular mechanisms 
in ocean microbial communities. Previously, I worked on the development of novel bacterial genome engineering tools at the San Francisco Bay 
Area-based biotech company Zymergen, and as a research associate on high throughput cell-based assays assessing the efficacy of 
HIV vaccine candidates at the Military HIV Research Program in Washington, D.C. I holds a B.S. in Molecular Cellular Developmental Biology 
and Neuroscience from the University of Colorado Boulder. In my free time I enjoy exploring the great outdoors with my partner Adrián and the 
great indoors with my two cats Anubis and Osiris.
