title: Phytoplankton ecology and physiology along environmental gradients
---
Our goal is to understand how nutrient and physico-chemical gradients shape the distribution, abundance and activity of environmentally and biogeochemically important phytoplankton groups, such as cyanobacteria and diatoms. We combine molecular tools, microscopy and flow cytometry to investigate the physiological and ecological responses of these organisms across a wide range of environmental conditions, using both laboratory cultures and natural populations of phytoplankton. Ultimately, this information will help us to predict to response of phytoplankton to future ocean conditions.
