I am the data engineer for Simons CMAP, the open-source data portal interconnecting data sets across oceanographic disciplines. My work has always centered around making data accessible and easy to understand, often through visualizing disparate data to convey the underlying story. My background in working with environmental data started with studying diatoms at the University of Washington.
