As the program operations specialist, I work with people internally across the University and externally at many organizations to provide administrative support to the Armbrust lab handling day-to-day operations, projects, and inquiries.  A large portion of my work involves overseeing the various grant budgets and other financial support that are used to fund the research for the lab by forecasting expenses and monitoring expenditures and assisting with HR related tasks and processes.
