**Research Scientist**  

I study how unicellular plankton respond to environmental perturbations and ultimately how they are adapting to warming oceans. My research approach combines mechanistic models with observations from the shipboard flow cytometer [SeaFlow](https://seaflow.netlify.com/) to infer growth and mortality rates, two key traits that govern how these organisms interact with their environment.
