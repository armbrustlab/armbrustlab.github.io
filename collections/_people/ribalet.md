**Research Scientist**  

I am investigating how marine phytoplankton respond to environmental perturbations and ultimately how they adapt to warming oceans. I apply population models to optical data collected by shipboard flow cytometers to estimate rates of cell growth and mortality, two key traits that govern how these organisms interact with their environment.
