**Principal Research Scientist**  
My research focuses on marine microbes and their biological feedbacks on the global carbon cycle. Marine microbes fix atmospheric CO2, generate biomass, recycle nutrients, and form the basis of the marine food web. They play an important role in regulating the Earth’s climate, yet we don’t know how these organisms will respond to future ocean conditions. I develop models guided by laboratory, field, and satellite observations to better understand microbial dynamics under current and future ocean conditions.
