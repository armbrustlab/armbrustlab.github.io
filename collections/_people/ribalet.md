**Principal Research Scientist**  
I am interest in ecosystem dynamics and biological feedbacks on marine biogeochemical cycles. My research involves the development of mathematical and data-driven models guided by laboratory, field, and satellite observations to predict cell, population, and ecosystem interactions under current and future ocean conditions.
