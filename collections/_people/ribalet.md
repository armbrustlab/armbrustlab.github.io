**Research Scientist**  

I am investigating how marine phytoplankton respond to environmental perturbations and ultimately how they adapt to warming oceans. I am investigating how unicellular plankton respond to environmental perturbations and ultimately how they adapt to warming oceans. I apply population models to plankton size distribution measured by flow cytometry to estimate rates of cell growth and mortality, two key traits that govern how these organisms interact with their environment.
