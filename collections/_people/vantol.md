## Research
### Constraint-based metabolic modeling of interaction between *Thalassiosira pseudonana* and *Ruegeria pomeroyi*:
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/thaps_ruepo.pdf" alt="Interaction" caption="Simulation between CCMP 1335 and DSS-3 captures known features ofthe interaction." %}
<p>For my Ph.D., I created genome-scale metabolic models of the diatom *Thalassiosira pseudonana* CCMP 1335 and the bacterium *Ruegeria pomeroyi* DSS-3 to investigate the dynamics of interaction between these two model marine organisms under different nutrient conditions.</p>
<p>Constraint-based metabolic models can be used to study the flux of metabolites and nutrients in marine microbes, connecting molecular information to the environment. These models have been used to integrate a wealth of different information types and to predict the metabolic behaviour of many different organisms.</p>
<p>In culture, growth of the diatom *Thalassiosira pseudonana* can be supported by vitamin B12-producing bacteria such as *Ruegeria pomeroyi*. In exchange *R. pomeroyi* receives organic carbon and sulfur from *T. pseudonana*. Vitamin B12 is the only organic compound required by most diatoms and it has been demonstrated that *R. pomeroyi* consumes 2,3-dihydroxypropane sulfonate (DHPS) and N-acetyltaurine produced by *T. pseudonana*, although there may be other molecules exchanged between these two organisms.</p>
<p>I used these models to study the dynamics of this interaction and investigate the possible exchange of other molecules.</p>

### Effect of *Croceibacter atlanticus* on cell division in *Thalassiosira pseudonana*:

<p>For my Master's project I studied interactions between the flavobacterium *Croceibacter atlanticus* and diatoms. *C. atlanticus* was isolated from the pennate chain-forming diatom *Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries*, and was found to inhibit growth in many different diatoms. When *C. atlanticus* was grown with the centric diatom *Thalassiosira pseudonana*, we observed large polyploid cells with multiple plastids. These features indicate that *C. atlanticus* may inhibit cytokinesis in diatoms.</p>
