Research interests:

I study how microorganism interact with each other in the ocean, focusing on molecular mechanisms of interactions between phytoplankton and bacteria. I am investigating these interactions in various ways, including controlled lab studies of cultured organisms, models of interactions based on environmental omics data, and field experiments.
