I am a graduate student in biological oceanography at UW. I apply bioinformatic and machine learning tools to sequencing datasets (metatranscriptomes) to examine the distribution and in-situ trophic mode of mixotrophic protists across the North Pacific Ocean. Pairing these analyses with experiments in the field and laboratory, I hope to elucidate the environmental factors that drive trophic mode shifts -- such as from autotrophy to phagotrophy -- of marine mixotrophic protists. I hold a B.S. in Biology from Carleton College. My research can be found here: https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wRwhrWsAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao.
