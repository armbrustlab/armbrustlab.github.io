I am the assistant to Dr. Armbrust. I work behind the scenes to facilitate administrative operations of our busy and dynamic lab. My role casts a wide net: From budget forecasting and scheduling to meeting coordination, purchasing and hospitality, it is all in an ever-changing day’s work. I also plan the quarterly seminar series jointly sponsored by the University of Washington and NOAA and their Centers for Oceans and Human Health. This series promotes dialogue among scientists, students and others who seek to understand the diverse and complex interactions of oceans and human health. In this age of global warming, I am privileged be part of this important research setting. It gives me joy to be a supportive presence to a wonderful group of talented, hard-working techs, students and scientists, known affectionately as the “Armbrusters.”
