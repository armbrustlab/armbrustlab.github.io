I study picophytoplankton distributions and environmental responses with flow cytometry. My interests involve synthesizing diverse datasets to model how these cells change over time and with their environment. Some of my work can be found here. I hold a B.S. in Marine Biology and Computer Science and an M.S. from the University of California San Diego. In my free time, I enjoy skiing, backpacking, climbing, and spending time with my 2 cats.
