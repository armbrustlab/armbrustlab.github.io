## Research Interests and Current Projects
#### Diatom-Bacteria Interactions

Diatoms have an important role in the Earth’s carbon cycle, but they are not alone: the nature of their relationships with other marine microbes determines the fate of their fixed carbon. I aim to use modern molecular and informatics techniques to understand these complex relationships, using model diatom-bacteria associations.

#### Metagenomics and Metatranscriptomics of Ocean Communities

The advent of novel sequencing technologies has opened up new windows for investigation of community structure and function. Dramatic decreases in sequencing cost-per-base has allowed for the collection of massive community data sets, but the task of extracting meaningful information from these large data presents a challenge. I am developing pipelines for analysis of many environmental samples in order to improve our understanding of biological processes at the genetic and transcriptional levels.
