SeaFlow is an shipboard underway flow cytometer that provides continuous single celled measurements of light scatter and fluorescence associated with the pigments chlorophyll a and phycoerythrin ([Swalwell et al. 2011](https://doi.org/10.4319/lom.2011.9.466)). Since 2010, we have operated SeaFlow for 14,000 hours across 140,000 km of ocean, collecting over 300,000 samples in surface waters. We have created Popcycle, an R package that use reproducible analytical methods to uniformly process and curate SeaFlow data. The current datasets consist of cell abundance, cell diameter and cellular carbon content of small phytoplankton (< 10 Î¼m), which includes the cyanobacteria <i>Prochlorococcus</i>, <i>Synechococcus</i> and <i>Crocosphaera</i>, and a mixture of unindentified protists.

* An example dataset representing the compilation of over 69,000 samples collected during 27 oceanographic cruises is available [here](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2678021) without restriction.

* Description of the SeaFlow data can be found in [Ribalet et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-019-0292-2).

* List of available data can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vT76VR2_VAulc6caxklUqOTOj_7EEnNJiFlHqaD1fC7Pc_zqw5i7wwcQUcDa8dtALZXoVHt2t0mdPS5/pubhtml).

We are currently generating estimate of cell growth and cell mortality rates, two key traits that govern how these organisms interact with their environment, for <i>Prochlorococcus</i> and <i>Synechococcus</i> using a [size-structured matrix population model](https://github.com/fribalet/Bayesian-matrixmodel).

### Software
* [popcycle](https://github.com/uwescience/popcycle) - an R package that analyzing continuous flow cytometry data from SeaFlow repository. The software is built to perform both coarse real-time data analysis and fine-tuned population clustering analysis.

* [seaflowpy](https://github.com/armbrustlab/seaflowpy) - Python libraries and scripts to complement ```popcycle```

* [Bayesian-matrixmodel](https://github.com/fribalet/Bayesian-matrixmodel) - A size-structured matrix population model to estimate hourly division rates of microbial populations from size distribution provided by SeaFlow data. These estimates are independent of variations in cell abundance and can be used to study physiologically-driven changes in population dynamics.
