SeaFlow is an shipboard underway flow cytometer that provides continuous multi-parameter single particle measurements of light scatter and fluorescence. Since 2010, our lab has operated SeaFlow for 14,000 hours across 140,000 km of ocean, collecting over 300,000 samples in surface waters.<br/><br/>
