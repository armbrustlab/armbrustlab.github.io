SeaFlow is an shipboard underway flow cytometer that provides continuous multi-parameter single particle measurements of light scatter and fluorescence associated with the pigments chlorophyll a and phycoerythrin. The SeaFlow instrument was developed by [Jarred Swalwell](https://armbrustlab.ocean.washington.edu/people/swalwell/) at the University of Washington. </br>
Since 2010, our lab has operated SeaFlow for 14,000 hours across 140,000 km of ocean, collecting over 300,000 samples in surface waters. We have created reproducible analytical methods to uniformly process and curate SeaFlow data across all datasets. Visit our **[SeaFlow website](https://seaflow.netlify.com/)** for more information.
