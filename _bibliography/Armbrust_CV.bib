	abstract = {Fossil-fuel emissions may impact phytoplankton primary productivity and carbon cycling by supplying bioavailable Fe to remote areas of the ocean via atmospheric aerosols. However, this pathway has not been confirmed by field observations of anthropogenic Fe in seawater. Here we present high-resolution trace-metal concentrations across the North Pacific Ocean (158°W from 25°to 42°N). A dissolved Fe maximum was observed around 35°N, coincident with high dissolved Pb and Pb isotope ratios matching Asian industrial sources and confirming recent aerosol deposition. Iron-stable isotopes reveal in situ evidence of anthropogenic Fe in seawater, with low δ56Fe (−0.23‰ {\textgreater} δ56Fe {\textgreater} −0.65‰) observed in the region that is most influenced by aerosol deposition. An isotope mass balance suggests that anthropogenic Fe contributes 21–59\% of dissolved Fe measured between 35° and 40°N. Thus, anthropogenic aerosol Fe is likely to be an important Fe source to the North Pacific Ocean.},

	abstract = {Recent studies point to the importance of oxygen (O2) in controlling the distribution and activity of marine ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), one of the most abundant prokaryotes in the ocean. The AOA are associated with regions of low O2 tension in oceanic oxygen minimum zones (OMZs), and O2 availability is suggested to influence their production of the ozone-depleting greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O). We show that marine AOA available in pure culture sustain high ammonia oxidation activity at low μM O2 concentrations, characteristic of suboxic regions of OMZs ({\textless}10 µM O2), and that atmospheric concentrations of O2 may inhibit the growth of some environmental populations. We quantify the increasing N2O production by marine AOA with decreasing O2 tensions, consistent with the plausibility of an AOA contribution to the accumulation of N2O at the oxic-anoxic redox boundaries of OMZs. Variable sensitivity to peroxide also suggests that endogenous or exogenous reactive oxygen species are of importance in determining the environmental distribution of some populations.},

	abstract = {Four mesophilic, neutrophilic, and aerobic marine ammonia-oxidizing archaea, designated strains SCM1T, HCA1T, HCE1T and PS0T, were isolated from a tropical marine fish tank, dimly lit deep coastal waters, the lower euphotic zone of coastal waters, and near-surface sediment in the Puget Sound estuary, respectively. Cells are straight or slightly curved small rods, 0.15–0.26 µm in diameter and 0.50–1.59 µm in length. Motility was not observed, although strain PS0T possesses genes associated with archaeal flagella and chemotaxis, suggesting it may be motile under some conditions. Cell membranes consist of glycerol dibiphytanyl glycerol tetraether (GDGT) lipids, with crenarchaeol as the major component. Strain SCM1T displays a single surface layer (S-layer) with p6 symmetry, distinct from the p3-S-layer reported for the soil ammonia-oxidizing archaeon Nitrososphaera viennensis EN76T. Respiratory quinones consist of fully saturated and monounsaturated menaquinones with 6 isoprenoid units in the side chain. Cells obtain energy from ammonia oxidation and use carbon dioxide as carbon source; addition of an α-keto acid (α-ketoglutaric acid) was necessary to sustain growth of strains HCA1T, HCE1T, and PS0T. Strain PS0T uses urea as a source of ammonia for energy production and growth. All strains synthesize vitamin B1 (thiamine), B2 (riboflavin), B6 (pyridoxine), and B12 (cobalamin). Optimal growth occurs between 25 and 32 °C, between pH 6.8 and 7.3, and between 25 and 37 ‰ salinity. All strains have a low mol\% G+C content of 33.0–34.2. Strains are related by 98 \% or greater 16S rRNA gene sequence identity, sharing {\textasciitilde}85 \% 16S rRNA gene sequence identity with Nitrososphaera viennensis EN76T. All four isolates are well separated by phenotypic and genotypic characteristics and are here assigned to distinct species within the genus Nitrosopumilus gen. nov. Isolates SCM1T (=ATCC TSD-97T =NCIMB 15022T), HCA1T (=ATCC TSD-96T), HCE1T (=ATCC TSD-98T), and PS0T (=ATCC TSD-99T) are type strains of the species Nitrosopumilus maritimus sp. nov., Nitrosopumilus cobalaminigenes sp. nov., Nitrosopumilus oxyclinae sp. nov., and Nitrosopumilus ureiphilus sp. nov., respectively.

	abstract = {Ammonia oxidizing archaea (AOA) have recently been recognized as the primary nitrifiers in the marine environment; they thus play an important role in the nitrogen cycle. Available genome sequences of AOA indicate that numerous Cu-dependent enzymes are essential for both ammonia oxidation and electron transfer, suggesting a particularly high requirement for copper. However, our knowledge of the copper requirements of AOA and their response to copper limitation in the ocean is nonexistent. Here, we examine the copper requirements of the chemolithoautotrophic AOA Candidatus Nitrosopumilus maritimus SCM1 using a combination of the metal chelators ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and 1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane-1,4,8,11-tetraacetic acid and show that ammonia oxidation is limited at free cupric ion concentrations {\textless} 10−12.7 mol L−1, which are higher than concentrations frequently reported for many coastal and oceanic regimes. Prolonged exposure of cells to copper starvation for up to 6 d had no effect on the recovery of ammonia oxidation by N. maritimus. In addition, we present evidence that N. maritimus does not produce a copper-binding ligand (chalkophore) under copper limitation and therefore probably relies mainly on acquisition of copper ions from surrounding media. Copper limitation may be an important constraint on archaeal ammonia oxidation throughout the marine environment.},

	abstract = {Summary: Diatoms and bacteria have cooccurred in common habitats for hundreds of millions of years, thus fostering specific associations and interactions with global biogeochemical consequences. Diatoms are responsible for one-fifth of the photosynthesis on Earth, while bacteria remineralize a large portion of this fixed carbon in the oceans. Through their coexistence, diatoms and bacteria cycle nutrients between oxidized and reduced states, impacting bioavailability and ultimately feeding higher trophic levels. Here we present an overview of how diatoms and bacteria interact and the implications of these interactions. We emphasize that heterotrophic bacteria in the oceans that are consistently associated with diatoms are confined to two phyla. These consistent bacterial associations result from encounter mechanisms that occur within a microscale environment surrounding a diatom cell. We review signaling mechanisms that occur in this microenvironment to pave the way for specific interactions. Finally, we discuss known interactions between diatoms and bacteria and exciting new directions and research opportunities in this field. Throughout the review, we emphasize new technological advances that will help in the discovery of new interactions. Deciphering the languages of diatoms and bacteria and how they interact will inform our understanding of the role these organisms have in shaping the ocean and how these interactions may change in future oceans.},

We investigated the relationship between marine picocyanobacteria and nanoplanktonic consumers throughout the diel cycle to determine whether heterotrophic and mixotrophic protists (algae with phagotrophic ability) display significant periodicity in grazing pressure. Carbon biomass of Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus was estimated continuously from abundances and cell size measurements made by flow cytometry. Picocyanobacterial dynamics were then compared to nanoplankton abundances and ingestion of fluorescently labeled bacteria measured every 4 h during a 4 d survey in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. Grazing of the labeled bacteria by heterotrophic nanoplankton was significantly greater at night than during the day. The grazing activity of mixotrophic nanoplankton showed no diel periodicity, suggesting that they may feed continuously, albeit at lower rates than heterotrophic nanoplankton, to alleviate nutrient limitation in this oligotrophic environment. Diel changes in Prochlorococcus biomass indicated that they could support substantial growth of nanoplankton if those grazers are the main source of picocyanobacterial mortality, and that grazers may contribute to temporally stable abundances of picocyanobacteria.},

Asexual reproduction and clonal lineages persist in these taxa despite theoretical arguments suggesting that individual clones should be evolutionarily short-lived due to limited phenotypic diversity. Here, we present quantitative evidence that an obligate asexual lineage emerged from a sexual population of the marine diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana and rapidly expanded throughout the world’s oceans. Whole genome comparisons identified two lineages with characteristics expected of sexually reproducing strains in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. A third lineage displays genomic signatures for the functional loss of sexual reproduction followed by a recent global colonization by a single ancestral genotype. Extant members of this lineage are genetically differentiated and phenotypically plastic, potentially allowing for rapid adaptation when they are challenged by natural selection. Such mechanisms may be expected to generate new clones within marginal populations of additional unicellular species, facilitating the exploration and colonization of novel environments, aided by exponential growth and ease of dispersal.},

These species exhibit a wide range of nutritional modes (many species possess multiple nutritional modes simultaneously) and are essential components at several trophic levels within food webs.Genetic analyses of protists have lagged behind those of other microbial taxa because protists have much larger genomes and more complicated gene expression patterns. Consequently, we have very limited knowledge about gene number, identity and function within many protistan lineages.Widespread application of targeted gene sequencing (most notably, of small-subunit rRNA genes) has greatly improved our knowledge of eukaryote phylogeny and provided a framework for an emerging taxonomy incorporating morphological and molecular information.A recently developed alternative approach to provide genetic information for ecologically important protistan taxa is transcriptome sequencing of cultured species. Transcriptomes are providing vital databases of genes for species that lack sequenced genomes.Transcriptomic studies of cultures and natural assemblages of phototrophic protists (phytoplankton) are revealing complex metabolic responses to environmental conditions (such as nutrient limitation and light regime), pathways that are involved in toxin production by some harmful algal species and changes in gene expression that are related to shifts in nutritional mode for mixotrophic species.The application of transcriptomic approaches to the study of protistan symbioses, predator–prey interactions and protist–bacterium interactions are beginning to reveal the molecular signalling that is involved in the recognition and response between microorganisms, providing insights into the origin of eukaryotic organelles and the structure of aquatic food webs.We now have an improved understanding of the physiological responses of ecologically relevant protistan species and trophic groups to environmental changes. This understanding, which has been garnered through omics studies, is being harnessed to improve the predictive capabilities of global biogeochemical models.},

The targeted genes were NR (nitrate reductase) and GSII (glutamine synthetase II), both required for nitrate utilization; PGP (phosphoglycolate phosphatase) and GDCT (glycine decarboxylase T-protein), both required for photorespiration; and SBP (sedoheptulose 1,7-bisphosphatase), required for carbon fixation (Calvin cycle). Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR was used to compare transcript abundances for these genes from T. pseudonana cells grown at two light intensities (50 or 300 μmol photons·m−2·s−1), at two temperatures (12 or 22°C), and on two different nitrogen sources (nitrate or ammonium). Transcript abundance (normalized to 18S rRNA) was higher for all five genes at the higher light intensity. At 12°C, fewer transcripts were detected for the Calvin cycle gene, whereas more transcripts were detected for the photorespiration and nitrate utilization genes. Nitrogen source affected transcript accumulation of the photorespiration and nitrate utilization genes but not the Calvin cycle gene. Extracellular concentrations of glycolate, a photorespiratory-specific product, were determined under the high light conditions and were found to decrease at 12°C and when cells were grown on ammonium. A hypothetical model is presented to explain the patterns of transcript accumulation and glycolate release in terms of energy balance within the cell.},

One isolate originated from Long Island Sound, New York, USA and the other originated from Jakarta Harbor, Indonesia. As expected from previous studies, oscillations between intervals of cell size reduction and cell size enlargement were observed for each sub-clone. For both isolates, sperm were easily detected, but cells resembling eggs and auxospores were rarely observed and fertilization was not confirmed, suggesting that the observed cell size increases may have resulted from a combination of asexual cell enlargement and rare auxosporulation. The two isolates differed in their minimum and maximum sizes, and the threshold size for the induction of sperm formation. However, the two sets of isolated sub-clones displayed comparable relationships between growth rate, sperm inducibility, and cell size relative to the minimum, maximum, and threshold sizes. Growth rate increased as cell size decreased during vegetative divisions until the threshold for sperm inducibility was crossed. Below the size threshold for sperm inducibility, growth rate declined as cell size continued to decrease. Smaller cells were susceptible to failure of normal cytokinesis and valve deposition, resulting in the formation of abnormally long and often multinucleate cells. Culture conditions may select against restoration of cell size via auxosporulation due to the relationship between growth rate and cell size.},

Here, we describe a sensitive, high throughput PCR-based automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) approach to determine the relative abundance of Pseudo-nitzschia species within natural communities over space and time. The method was quantitatively validated using simplified mixtures of DNA or ITS1 standards from isolates of P. pungens, P. multiseries, and P. delicatissima. Relative abundance calculations based on ARISA profiles from these mixtures reflected input ratios, with minor deviations resulting from intraspecific variability. ARISA was used to identify and quantify at least 8 species within Puget Sound and the eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca, Washington, USA: P. americana, P. australis/P. seriata, P. cuspidata, P. delicatissima, P. fraudulenta, P. fryxelliana, P. multiseries, and P. pungens; genotypes corresponding to P. pungens var. 
pungens and P. pungens var. cingulata were identified by environmental sequencing. The different species were significantly correlated with physical (temperature, salinity), biological (chlorophyll a fluorescence, oxygen), and/or chemical (ammonium, nutrient ratios) factors. The ability to determine shifts in the relative abundance of Pseudo-nitzschia species over spatial and temporal scales relevant to dispersion and selection facilitates dissection of the varied mechanisms driving vertical and horizontal species distribution patterns in hydrographically complex systems.},

Because genetic subdivision within species can reveal potential speciation mechanisms, we examined genetic differentiation and patterns of gene flow among four populations of the diatom Ditylum brightwellii. Single-cell isolates were examined at two microsatellite markers and two rDNA loci (18S and internal transcribed spacer region I (ITSI)). Among isolates, rDNA sequences varied by 0.08±0.04\% (18S) and 0.7±0.3\% (ITSI) and there were no compensatory base pair changes in the predicted ITSI secondary structure, all suggesting that a single species was represented. Two numerically dominant ITSI sequence types were detected and their distribution among isolates from genetically distinct populations was significantly different. Two populations shared ITSI sequence type 1 and two shared ITSI sequence type 2, indicating differences in relatedness among populations. The signature of unequal gene flow among populations suggested that D. brightwellii exhibited a metapopulation structure: the species was subdivided into populations of populations. The identification of metapopulations suggests a possible mechanism of speciation through reduced levels of gene flow, providing newly evolved taxa with a large repository of genetic and physiological diversity and perhaps significant adaptive potential.},

A cDNA (GDCT) with a deduced amino acid sequence sharing up to 64\% homology and 50\% identity with the T-protein subunit of GDC from land plants was identified from the centric diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii (Grun.) Fryxell et Hasle. The effect of light on transcript abundance was determined using competitive RT-PCR. GDCT mRNA per cell decreased during prolonged dark incubations and was higher in cells grown at higher light intensities, independent of growth rate. Cells acclimated to a 12:12-h light:dark cycle maintained the same amount of GDCT transcripts before and after the dark phase, but rapidly increased transcript levels in the light with a peak “mid-day.” Rapid increases in GDCT message abundance also occurred in response to an increase in irradiance. Transcript abundance of twca1, the gene for carbonic anhydrase, was also measured and displayed a slower and much less pronounced response to changes in light intensity. An HPLC-based method was used to measure the concentration of the photorespiratory-specific compound glycolate in the culturemedia. Only cultures shifted from low subsaturating irradiances to the highest light intensity released significant amounts of glycolate. Our results suggest that quantifying GDCT mRNA in conjunction with measurements of glycolate will allow us to monitor both the initiation of photorespiration and its physiological consequences in the marine environment.},

However, data on life cycles and sexuality within the genus are fragmentary. A clone of the cosmopolitan marine diatom Thalassiosira punctigera Cleve emend. Hasle was isolated from the North Sea and oogamous sexual reproduction was observed in culture. Cells approximately 45 μm and smaller became sexualized. Oogonia were produced preferentially and spermatogenesis was infrequent. Unfertilized oogonia always aborted and their development was apparently arrested at prophase of meiosis I. Further progression through meiosis and auxospore formation occurred only after a sperm had penetrated into the oocyte. Many cells of the new large-celled generation (approximately 90–120 μm in size) immediately became sexualized again but only oogonia were produced. A few of the large oogonia became auxospores and produced initial cells 132–153 μm in diameter. The second step of auxosporulation probably involved fertilization of large-celled oocytes by the sperm of the small-celled spermatogonangia that were still present in the culture. An F1 clone obtained after selfing within the small-celled auxosporulation size range was investigated. Like the parent clone, the F1 clone was homothallic but no auxosporulation was observed: spermatogonangia were unable to produce viable sperm, apparently because of inbreeding depression. Aggregation and interaction of oogonia were documented, and may be relevant for understanding the mechanisms of signaling and recognition between sexualized cells and the evolution of sexuality in pennate diatoms.},

Calanus euxinus, recently designated as a distinct species though closely related to C. helgolandicus, occurs in the Black Sea. Very subtle morphological differences distinguish the two species. Pseudocalanus elongatus has a similar geographic range including North Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea. In this study, population genetic variation of C. helgolandicus, C. euxinus and P. elongatus was investigated using DNA sequence variation of 540 base pair (Calanus spp.) and 575 base pair (P. elongatus) regions of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (mtCOI) gene. C. helgolandicus was collected from the English Channel, the Adriatic Sea, and C. euxinus was collected from various regions of the Black Sea. P. elongatus was collected from the English Channel and the Black Sea. Intraspecific differentiation in mtCOI was {\textless}1\% for all species; mtCOI sequence variation between C. helgolandicus and C. euxinus was {\textless}0.5\%. The absence of substantial genetic differentiation between C. helgolandicus and C. euxinus is particularly striking in comparison to other close species pairs in these genera. Statistically significant haplotype frequency differences were determined for different locations of the Black Sea, English Channel, and Adriatic Sea Calanus populations (χ2=3.94, P{\textless}0.0001). The haplotype diversity was high for all species: C. euxinus (h=0.92), C. helgolandicus (h⩽0.80), P. elongatus (h⩽0.60). No haplotype sharing was reported for different locations of P. elongatus, whereas the presence of haplotype sharing between C. helgolandicus and C. euxinus was remarkable. The size distribution in terms of prosome length measurements was found to be region-specific. The lack of phylogenetic differentiation between the Calanus species pair may suggest ancestral polymorphisms. The morphological and genetic similarities between C. euxinus and C. helgolandicus raise new questions about the status of C. euxinus as a different species.},

Their growth, demise, and interactions with other microorganisms drive the fluxes of biogeochemical elements through marine ecosystems. Mixotrophic protists are capable of both photosynthesis and ingestion of prey and are dominant components of open-ocean planktonic communities. Yet the role of mixotrophs in elemental cycling is obscured by their capacity to act as primary producers or heterotrophic consumers depending on factors that remain largely uncharacterized. Here, we develop and apply a machine learning model that predicts the in situ trophic mode of aquatic protists based on their patterns of gene expression. This approach leverages a public collection of protist transcriptomes as a training set to identify a subset of gene families whose transcriptional profiles predict trophic mode. We applied our model to nearly 100 metatranscriptomes obtained during two oceanographic cruises in the North Pacific and found community-level and population-specific evidence that abundant open-ocean mixotrophic populations shift their predominant mode of nutrient and carbon acquisition in response to natural gradients in nutrient supply and sea surface temperature. Metatranscriptomic data from ship-board incubation experiments revealed that abundant mixotrophic prymnesiophytes from the oligotrophic North Pacific subtropical gyre rapidly remodeled their transcriptome to enhance photosynthesis when supplied with limiting nutrients. Coupling this approach with experiments designed to reveal the mechanisms driving mixotroph physiology provides an avenue toward understanding the ecology of mixotrophy in the natural environment.},

Both genomes have {\textgreater}21,000 protein genes and are intron rich, and B. natans exhibits unprecedented alternative splicing for a single-celled organism. Phylogenomic analyses and subcellular targeting predictions reveal extensive genetic and biochemical mosaicism, with both host- and endosymbiont-derived genes servicing the mitochondrion, the host cell cytosol, the plastid and the remnant endosymbiont cytosol of both algae.

	abstract = {The rates of cell growth, division, and carbon loss of microbial populations are key parameters for understanding how organisms interact with their environment and how they contribute to the carbon cycle. However, the invasive nature of current analytical methods has hindered efforts to reliably quantify these parameters. In recent years, size-structured matrix population models (MPMs) have gained popularity for estimating division rates of microbial populations by mechanistically describing changes in microbial cell size distributions over time. Motivated by the mechanistic structure of these models, we employ a Bayesian approach to extend size-structured MPMs to capture additional biological processes describing the dynamics of a marine phytoplankton population over the day-night cycle. Our Bayesian framework is able to take prior scientific knowledge into account and generate biologically interpretable results. Using data from an exponentially growing laboratory culture of the cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus, we isolate respiratory and exudative carbon losses as critical parameters for the modeling of their population dynamics. The results suggest that this modeling framework can provide deeper insights into microbial population dynamics provided by size distribution time-series data.},

	abstract = {Automated, ship-board flow cytometers provide high-resolution maps of phytoplankton composition over large swaths of the world's oceans. They therefore pave the way for understanding how environmental conditions shape community structure. Identification of community changes along a cruise transect commonly segments the data into distinct regions. However, existing segmentation methods are generally not applicable to flow cytometry data, as these data are recorded as ‘point cloud’ data, with hundreds or thousands of particles measured during each time interval. Moreover, nonparametric segmentation methods that do not rely on prior knowledge of the number of species are desirable to map community shifts. We present CytoSegmenter, a kernel-based change-point estimation method for segmenting point cloud data. Our method allows us to represent and summarize a point cloud of data points by a single element in a Hilbert space. The change-point locations can be found using a fast dynamic programming algorithm. Through an analysis of 12 cruises, we demonstrate that CytoSegmenter allows us to locate abrupt changes in phytoplankton community structure. We show that the changes in community structure generally coincide with changes in the temperature and salinity of the ocean. We also illustrate how the main parameter of CytoSegmenter can be easily calibrated using limited auxiliary annotated data. CytoSegmenter is generally applicable for segmenting series of point cloud data from any domain. Moreover, it readily scales to thousands of point clouds, each containing thousands of points. In the context of flow cytometry data collected during research cruises, it does not require prior clustering of particles to define taxa labels, eliminating a potential source of error. This represents an important advance in automating the analysis of large datasets now emerging in biological oceanography and other fields. It also allows for the approach to be applied during research cruises.},

	abstract = {A characteristic feature of early zygote development in Chlamydomonas is the selective degradation of chloroplast DNA from the mating type minus parent. The zygote-specific gene cluster ezy-1 is linked to the mating type locus and is transcribed almost immediately upon zygote formation. We show here that the acidic Ezy-1 polypeptide is rapidly transported to both the plus and minus chloroplasts, where it interacts with each chloroplast nucleoid. Expression of ezy-1 is selectively inhibited when plus, but not minus, gametes are briefly ultraviolet irradiated just prior to mating, a treatment known to disrupt the uniparental inheritance of chloroplast traits. We propose that the Ezy-1 polypeptide participates in the destruction of the minus chloroplast DNA in zygotes and thus the uniparental Inheritance of chloroplast traits. The ezy-1 gene represents a valuable molecular probe for dissecting mechanisms underlying organelle inheritance.},

	abstract = {BackgroundDiatoms are unicellular algae responsible for approximately 20\% of global carbon fixation. Their evolution by secondary endocytobiosis resulted in a complex cellular structure and metabolism compared to algae with primary plastids.Methodology/Principal FindingsThe whole genome sequence of the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum has recently been completed. We identified and annotated genes for enzymes involved in carbohydrate pathways based on extensive EST support and comparison to the whole genome sequence of a second diatom, Thalassiosira pseudonana. Protein localization to mitochondria was predicted based on identified similarities to mitochondrial localization motifs in other eukaryotes, whereas protein localization to plastids was based on the presence of signal peptide motifs in combination with plastid localization motifs previously shown to be required in diatoms. We identified genes potentially involved in a C4-like photosynthesis in P. tricornutum and, on the basis of sequence-based putative localization of relevant proteins, discuss possible differences in carbon concentrating mechanisms and CO2 fixation between the two diatoms. We also identified genes encoding enzymes involved in photorespiration with one interesting exception: glycerate kinase was not found in either P. tricornutum or T. pseudonana. Various Calvin cycle enzymes were found in up to five different isoforms, distributed between plastids, mitochondria and the cytosol. Diatoms store energy either as lipids or as chrysolaminaran (a β-1,3-glucan) outside of the plastids. We identified various β-glucanases and large membrane-bound glucan synthases. Interestingly most of the glucanases appear to contain C-terminal anchor domains that may attach the enzymes to membranes.Conclusions/SignificanceHere we present a detailed synthesis of carbohydrate metabolism in diatoms based on the genome sequences of Thalassiosira pseudonana and Phaeodactylum tricornutum. This model provides novel insights into acquisition of dissolved inorganic carbon and primary metabolic pathways of carbon in two different diatoms, which is of significance for an improved understanding of global carbon cycles.},

Viruses are considered a major source of microbial mortality, however, current methods to measure infection have significant methodological limitations. Here we describe a method that pairs flow-cytometric sorting with a PCR-based polony technique to simultaneously screen thousands of taxonomically resolved individual cells for intracellular virus DNA, enabling sensitive, high-throughput, and direct quantification of infection by different virus lineages. Under controlled conditions with picocyanobacteria-cyanophage models, the method detected infection throughout the lytic cycle and discriminated between varying infection levels. In North Pacific subtropical surface waters, the method revealed that only a small percentage of Prochlorococcus (0.35–1.6\%) were infected, predominantly by T4-like cyanophages, and that infection oscillated 2-fold in phase with the diel cycle. This corresponds to 0.35–4.8\% of Prochlorococcus mortality daily. Cyanophages were 2–4-fold more abundant than Prochlorococcus, indicating that most encounters did not result in infection and suggesting infection is mitigated via host resistance, reduced phage infectivity and inefficient adsorption. This method will enable quantification of infection for key microbial taxa across oceanic regimes and will help determine the extent that viruses shape microbial communities and ecosystem level processes.},

To determine how increased CO2 concentrations impact the physiology of the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana Hasle et Heimdal, nitrate-limited chemostats were used to acclimate cells to a recent past (333 ± 6 μatm) and two projected future concentrations (476 ± 18 μatm, 816 ± 35 μatm) of CO2. Samples were harvested under steady-state growth conditions after either an abrupt (15–16 generations) or a longer acclimation process (33–57 generations) to increased CO2 concentrations. The use of un-bubbled chemostat cultures allowed us to calculate the uptake ratio of dissolved inorganic carbon relative to dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIC:DIN), which was strongly correlated with fCO2 in the shorter acclimations but not in the longer acclimations. Both CO2 treatment and acclimation time significantly affected the DIC:DIN uptake ratio. Chlorophyll a per cell decreased under elevated CO2 and the rates of photosynthesis and respiration decreased significantly under higher levels of CO2. These results suggest that T. pseudonana shifts carbon and energy fluxes in response to high CO2 and that acclimation time has a strong effect on the physiological response.},

Low oxygen waters were enriched in NO2-cobalamin, and AOA isolates experiencing ammonia or copper stress produced more NO2-cobalamin, though there is wide strain-to-strain and batch-to-batch variability. NO2-cobalamin has no known biochemical role. We hypothesize that AOA and anammox bacteria are a source of marine NO2-cobalamin in the environment via a reactive nitrogen intermediate. These findings suggest connections between cobalamin forms and nitrogen transformations, physiological stress and ocean deoxygenation.},

Comparative analysis identified seven major marine AOA genotypic groups having gene content correlated with their distinctive biogeographies. Phosphorus and ammonia availabilities as well as hydrostatic pressure were identified as selective forces driving marine AOA genotypic and gene content variability in different oceanic regions. Notably, AOA methylphosphonate biosynthetic genes span diverse oceanic provinces, reinforcing their importance for methane production in the ocean. Together, our combined comparative physiological, genomic, and metagenomic analyses provide a comprehensive view of the biogeography of globally abundant AOA and their adaptive radiation into a vast range of marine and terrestrial habitats.},

Evidence that links the presence of AOA with in situ ammonia oxidation activity is limited, and the abiotic factors that regulate the distribution of AOA natural assemblages are not well defined. We used quantitative PCR to enumerate amoA (encodes α-subunit of ammonia monooxygenase) abundances; AOA amoA gene copies greatly outnumbered ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and amoA transcripts were derived primarily from AOA throughout the water column of Hood Canal, Puget Sound, WA, USA. We generated a Michaelis–Menten kinetics curve for ammonia oxidation by the natural community and found that the measured Km of 98±14 nmol l−1 was close to that for cultivated AOA representative Nitrosopumilus maritimus SCM1. Temperature did not have a significant effect on ammonia oxidation rates for incubation temperatures ranging from 8 to 20 °C, which is within the temperature range for depths of measurable ammonia oxidation at the site. This study provides substantial evidence, through both amoA gene copies and transcript abundances and the kinetics response, that AOA are the dominant active ammonia oxidizers in this marine environment. We propose that future ammonia oxidation experiments use a Km for the natural community to better constrain ammonia oxidation rates determined with the commonly used 15NH4+ dilution technique.},

Cells with only phycoerythrobilin chromophores were distinguished from those with both phycoerythrobilin and phycourobilin (PUB) chromophores by exciting with 488 nm light and measuring the resulting phycoerythrin fluorescence below 560 nm (green) and above 560 nm (orange). All populations detected had green/orange emission ratios similar to PUB-containing strains of Synechococcus in culture. In addition, the ratio of fluorescence emission intensity resulting from excitation at 488 and 515 nm was used to measure the relative PUB content of the cells. In the majority of samples, we found ratios as high or higher than those of the cultured strains considered to have unusually high PUB contents. These findings suggest that our perception of the characteristics of Synechococcus populations in the open ocean may have been biased by studies of cells from culture collections. According to our survey, virtually all Synechococcus cells in the open ocean contain PUB and most of them have very high relative PUB contents. This gives them absorption properties not very different from those of the eukaryotic phytoplankton, and this could explain why photosynthetic action spectra have suggested that light absorption by phycoerythrobilin-rich phycoerythrin (at about 550 nm) is relatively unimportant in the open ocean.},

We used the model diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana to study the antagonistic impact in more detail. In co-culture, C. atlanticus attaches to T. pseudonana and inhibits cell division, inducing diatom cells to become larger and increase in chlorophyll a fluorescence. These changes could be explained by an absence of cytokinesis that causes individual T. pseudonana cells to elongate, accumulate more plastids and become polyploid. These morphological changes could benefit C. atlanticus by augmenting the colonizable surface area of the diatom, its photosynthetic capabilities and possibly its metabolic secretions.},

Yet, specific factors that determine community composition and metabolic activity are difficult to resolve in complex microbial populations, complicating predictions of microbial processes in a changing ocean. Microbial metabolism generates small organic molecules that reflect both the biochemical and physiological diversity as well as the taxonomic specificity of these biological processes. These small molecules serve as the conduit for taxon-specific signaling and exchange. Here, we use liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics to taxonomically categorize 111 metabolites that include small molecules in central and secondary metabolism across 42 taxa representing numerically dominant and metabolically important lineages of microbial autotrophs and heterotrophs. Patterns in metabolite presence-absence broadly reflected taxonomic lineages. A subset of metabolites that includes osmolytes, sulfur-containing metabolites, sugars, and amino acid derivatives provided chemotaxonomic information among phytoplankton taxa. A variety of phytohormones and signaling molecules were predominantly found in the heterotrophic bacteria and archaea, expanding knowledge of metabolites implicated in modulating interactions between microbes. This chemotaxonomic inventory of marine microbial metabolites is a key step in deciphering metabolic networks that influence ocean biogeochemical cycles.},

Diatoms are members of the eukaryotic lineage of stramenopiles. Of the hundreds of diatom genera, two produce long fibers of chitin that extrude through their cell walls of silica. We identify and describe here genes encoding putative chitin synthases in a variety of additional diatom genera, indicating that the ability to produce chitin is more widespread and likely plays a more central role in diatom biology than previously considered. Diatom chitin synthases fall into four phylogenetic clades. Protein domain predictions and differential gene expression patterns provide evidence that chitin synthases have multiple functions within a diatom cell. Thalassiosira pseudonana possesses six genes encoding three types of chitin synthases. Transcript abundance of the gene encoding one of these chitin synthase types increases when cells resume division after short-term silicic acid starvation and during short-term limitation by silicic acid or iron, two nutrient conditions connected in the environment and known to affect the cell wall. During long-term silicic acid starvation transcript abundance of this gene and one additional chitin synthase gene increased at the same time a chitin-binding lectin localized to the girdle band region of the cell wall. Together, these results suggest that the ability to produce chitin is more widespread in diatoms than previously thought and that a subset of the chitin produced by diatoms is associated with the cell wall.},

All five chromist genomes are compact, with small intergenic regions and no introns. The three diatom genomes are similar in gene content with 127–130 protein-coding genes, and genes for 27 tRNAs, three ribosomal RNAs and two small RNAs (tmRNA and signal recognition particle RNA). All three genomes have open-reading frames corresponding to ORFs148, 355 and 380 of O. sinensis, which have been assigned the names ycf88, ycf89 and ycf90. Gene order is not strictly conserved, but there are a number of conserved gene clusters showing remnants of red algal origin. The acpP, tsf and psb28 genes appear to be on the way from the plastid to the host nucleus, indicating that endosymbiotic gene transfer is a continuing process.},

	abstract = {Vibrio is a diverse genus of Gammaproteobacteria autochthonous to marine environments worldwide. Vibrio diabolicus and V. antiquarius were originally isolated from deep-sea hydrothermal fields in the East Pacific Rise. These species are closely related to members of the Harveyi clade (e.g., V. alginolyticus and V. parahaemolyticus) that are commonly isolated from coastal systems. This study reports the discovery and draft genome sequence of a novel isolate (Vibrio sp. 939) cultured from Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas). Questions surrounding the identity of Vibrio sp. 939 motivated a genome-scale taxonomic analysis of the Harveyi clade. A 49-genome phylogeny based on 1,109 conserved coding sequences and a comparison of average nucleotide identity (ANI) values revealed a clear case of synonymy between Vibrio sp. 939, V. diabolicus Art-Gut C1 and CNCM I-1629, V. antiquarius EX25 and four V. alginolyticus strains (E0666, FF273, TS13, and V2). This discovery expands the V. diabolicus species and makes available six additional genomes for comparative genomic analyses. The distribution of the expanded species is thought to be global given the range of isolation sources (horse mackerel, seawater, sediment, dentex, oyster, artemia and polycheate) and origins (China, India, Greece, United States, East Pacific Rise, and Chile). A subsequent comparative genomic analysis of this new eight-genome subclade revealed a high degree of individual genome plasticity and a large repertoire of genes related to virulence and defense. These findings represent a significant revision to the understanding of V. diabolicus and V. antiquarius as both have long been regarded as distinct species. This first look at the expanded V. diabolicus subclade suggests that the distribution and diversity of this species mirrors that of other Harveyi clade species, which are notable for their ubiquity and diversity.},

	abstract = {In vast expanses of the oceans, growth of large phytoplankton such as diatoms is limited by iron availability. Diatoms respond almost immediately to the delivery of iron and rapidly compose the majority of phytoplankton biomass. The molecular bases underlying the subsistence of diatoms in iron-poor waters and the plankton community dynamics that follow iron resupply remain largely unknown. Here we use comparative metatranscriptomics to identify changes in gene expression associated with iron-stimulated growth of diatoms and other eukaryotic plankton. A microcosm iron-enrichment experiment using mixed-layer waters from the northeastern Pacific Ocean resulted in increased proportions of diatom transcripts and reduced proportions of transcripts from most other taxa within 98 h after iron addition. Hundreds of diatom genes were differentially expressed in the iron-enriched community compared with the iron-limited community; transcripts of diatom genes required for synthesis of photosynthesis and chlorophyll components, nitrate assimilation and the urea cycle, and synthesis of carbohydrate storage compounds were significantly overrepresented. Transcripts of genes encoding rhodopsins in eukaryotic phytoplankton were significantly underrepresented following iron enrichment, suggesting rhodopsins help cells cope with low-iron conditions. Oceanic diatoms appear to display a distinctive transcriptional response to iron enrichment that allows chemical reduction of available nitrogen and carbon sources along with a continued dependence on iron-free photosynthetic proteins rather than substituting for iron-containing functional equivalents present within their gene repertoire. This ability of diatoms to divert their newly acquired iron toward nitrate assimilation may underlie why diatoms consistently dominate iron enrichments in high-nitrate, low-chlorophyll regions.},

The persistence of high taxonomic diversity despite competition for a small suite of relatively homogeneously distributed nutrients, that is, ‘the paradox of the plankton’, represents a long-standing challenge for ecological theory. Here we find evidence consistent with temporal niche partitioning of nitrogen assimilation processes over a diel cycle in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. We jointly analysed transcript abundances, lipids and metabolites and discovered that a small number of diel archetypes can explain pervasive periodic dynamics. Metabolic pathway analysis of identified diel signals revealed asynchronous timing in the transcription of nitrogen uptake and assimilation genes among different microbial groups—cyanobacteria, heterotrophic bacteria and eukaryotes. This temporal niche partitioning of nitrogen uptake emerged despite synchronous transcription of photosynthesis and central carbon metabolism genes and associated macromolecular abundances. Temporal niche partitioning may be a mechanism by which microorganisms in the open ocean mitigate competition for scarce resources, supporting community coexistence.},

	abstract = {Marine ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) are among the most abundant of marine microorganisms, spanning nearly the entire water column of diverse oceanic provinces. Historical patterns of abundance are preserved in sediments in the form of their distinctive glycerol dibiphytanyl glycerol tetraether (GDGT) membrane lipids. The correlation between the composition of GDGTs in surface sediment and the overlying annual average sea surface temperature forms the basis for a paleotemperature proxy (TEX86) that is used to reconstruct surface ocean temperature as far back as the Middle Jurassic. However, mounting evidence suggests that factors other than temperature could also play an important role in determining GDGT distributions. We here use a study set of four marine AOA isolates to demonstrate that these closely related strains generate different TEX86–temperature relationships and that oxygen (O2) concentration is at least as important as temperature in controlling TEX86 values in culture. All of the four strains characterized showed a unique membrane compositional response to temperature, with TEX86-inferred temperatures varying as much as 12 °C from the incubation temperatures. In addition, both linear and nonlinear TEX86–temperature relationships were characteristic of individual strains. Increasing relative abundance of GDGT-2 and GDGT-3 with increasing O2 limitation, at the expense of GDGT-1, led to significant elevations in TEX86-derived temperature. Although the adaptive significance of GDGT compositional changes in response to both temperature and O2 is unclear, this observation necessitates a reassessment of archaeal lipid-based paleotemperature proxies, particularly in records that span low-oxygen events or underlie oxygen minimum zones.},

We performed Lagrangian diel sampling with synoptic measurements of population abundances, dinitrogen (N2) fixation, mortality, productivity, export and transcription in a bloom of Crocosphaera over eight days in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG). Quantitative transcriptomic analyses revealed clear diel oscillations in transcript abundances for 34\% of Crocosphaera genes identified, reflecting a systematic progression of gene expression in diverse metabolic pathways. Significant time-lagged correspondence was evident between nifH transcript abundance and maximal N2 fixation, as well as sepF transcript abundance and cell division, demonstrating the utility of transcriptomics to predict the occurrence and timing of physiological and biogeochemical processes in natural populations. Indirect estimates of carbon fixation by Crocosphaera were equivalent to 11\% of net community production, suggesting that under bloom conditions this diazotroph has a considerable impact on the wider carbon cycle. Our cross-scale synthesis of molecular, population and community-wide data underscores the tightly coordinated in situ metabolism of the keystone N2-fixing cyanobacterium Crocosphaera, as well as the broader ecosystem-wide implications of its activities.},

	abstract = {About half the carbon fixed by phytoplankton in the ocean is taken up and metabolized by marine bacteria, a transfer that is mediated through the seawater dissolved organic carbon (DOC) pool. The chemical complexity of marine DOC, along with a poor understanding of which compounds form the basis of trophic interactions between bacteria and phytoplankton, have impeded efforts to identify key currencies of this carbon cycle link. Here, we used transcriptional patterns in a bacterial-diatom model system based on vitamin B12 auxotrophy as a sensitive assay for metabolite exchange between marine plankton. The most highly up-regulated genes (up to 374-fold) by a marine Roseobacter clade bacterium when cocultured with the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana were those encoding the transport and catabolism of 2,3-dihydroxypropane-1-sulfonate (DHPS). This compound has no currently recognized role in the marine microbial food web. As the genes for DHPS catabolism have limited distribution among bacterial taxa, T. pseudonana may use this sulfonate for targeted feeding of beneficial associates. Indeed, DHPS was both a major component of the T. pseudonana cytosol and an abundant microbial metabolite in a diatom bloom in the eastern North Pacific Ocean. Moreover, transcript analysis of the North Pacific samples provided evidence of DHPS catabolism by Roseobacter populations. Other such biogeochemically important metabolites may be common in the ocean but difficult to discriminate against the complex chemical background of seawater. Bacterial transformation of this diatom-derived sulfonate represents a previously unidentified and likely sizeable link in both the marine carbon and sulfur cycles.},

The PCR primers were used to explore glcD diversity in four field samples collected from different ocean environments: an Atlantic Gulf Stream Ring, sampled above and below the thermocline and two Pacific coastal sites, Parks Bay and San Juan Channel, WA. Environmental glcD sequences belonged to six major bacterial phylogenetic groups, with most sequences forming novel clades with no close relatives. Different patterns of glcD diversity were observed within and between the two nutrient regimes. Comparison of glcD and 16S rDNA diversity and analyses of available bacterial genomes and a metgenomic library from the Sargasso Sea show that glycolate-utilizing potential exists in only a subset of bacteria. Glycolate is produced in marine environments mainly by phytoplankton. Examination of glcD diversity will aid in understanding the influence of phytoplankton on bacterial community structure.},

Current mass spectrometry methods do not quantify all forms of B12, potentially missing a significant portion of the B12 pool. METHODS We present a method to measure vitamins B1, B2, B6, B7 and four forms of B12 dissolved in seawater. The method entails solid-phase extraction, separation by ultra-performance liquid chromatography, and detection by triple-quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry using stable-isotope-labeled internal standards. We demonstrated the use of this method in the environment by analyzing B12 concentrations at different depths in the Hood Canal, part of the Puget Sound estuarine system in Washington State. RESULTS Recovery of vitamin B12 forms during the preconcentration steps was {\textgreater}71\% and the limits of detection were {\textless}0.275 pM in seawater. Standard addition calibration curves in three different seawater matrices were used to determine analytical response and to quantify samples from the environment. Hydroxocobalamin was the main form of B12 in seawater at our field site. CONCLUSIONS We developed a method for quantifying four forms of B12 in seawater by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry with the option of simultaneous analysis of vitamins B1, B2, B6, and B7.

Here, we report a potential bioindicator of a shift in the resilience of a coastal and centric model diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana under elevated CO2. Specifically, we have discovered, through EGFP-tagging, a plastid membrane localized putative Na+(K+)/H+ antiporter that is significantly upregulated at {\textgreater}800 ppm CO2, with a potentially important role in maintaining pH homeostasis. Notably, transcript abundance of this antiporter gene was relatively low and constant over the diel cycle under contemporary CO2 conditions. In future acidified oceanic conditions, dramatic oscillation with {\textgreater}10-fold change between nighttime (high) and daytime (low) transcript abundances of the antiporter was associated with increased resilience of T. pseudonana. By analyzing metatranscriptomic data from the Tara Oceans project, we demonstrate that phylogenetically diverse diatoms express homologs of this antiporter across the globe. We propose that the differential between night- and daytime transcript levels of the antiporter could serve as a bioindicator of a shift in the resilience of diatoms in response to high CO2 conditions in marine environments.},

	abstract = {The 24-h cycle of light and darkness governs daily rhythms of complex behaviors across all domains of life. Intracellular photoreceptors sense specific wavelengths of light that can reset the internal circadian clock and/or elicit distinct phenotypic responses. In the surface ocean, microbial communities additionally modulate nonrhythmic changes in light quality and quantity as they are mixed to different depths. Here, we show that eukaryotic plankton in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre transcribe genes encoding light-sensitive proteins that may serve as light-activated transcription factors, elicit light-driven electrical/chemical cascades, or initiate secondary messenger-signaling cascades. Overall, the protistan community relies on blue light-sensitive photoreceptors of the cryptochrome/photolyase family, and proteins containing the Light-Oxygen-Voltage (LOV) domain. The greatest diversification occurred within Haptophyta and photosynthetic stramenopiles where the LOV domain was combined with different DNA-binding domains and secondary signal-transduction motifs. Flagellated protists utilize green-light sensory rhodopsins and blue-light helmchromes, potentially underlying phototactic/photophobic and other behaviors toward specific wavelengths of light. Photoreceptors such as phytochromes appear to play minor roles in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. Transcript abundance of environmental light-sensitive protein-encoding genes that display diel patterns are found to primarily peak at dawn. The exceptions are the LOV-domain transcription factors with peaks in transcript abundances at different times and putative phototaxis photoreceptors transcribed throughout the day. Together, these data illustrate the diversity of light-sensitive proteins that may allow disparate groups of protists to respond to light and potentially synchronize patterns of growth, division, and mortality within the dynamic ocean environment.},

	abstract = {Open-ocean surface waters host a diverse community of single-celled eukaryotic plankton (protists) consisting of phototrophs, heterotrophs, and mixotrophs. The productivity and biomass of these organisms oscillate over diel cycles, and yet the underlying transcriptional processes are known for few members of the community. Here, we examined a 4-day diel time series of transcriptional abundance profiles for the protist community (0.2–100 μm in cell size) in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre near Station ALOHA. De novo assembly of poly-A+ selected metatranscriptomes yielded over 30 million contigs with taxonomic and functional annotations assigned to 54 and 25\% of translated contigs, respectively. The completeness of the resulting environmental eukaryotic taxonomic bins was assessed, and 48 genera were further evaluated for diel patterns in transcript abundances. These environmental transcriptome bins maintained reproducible temporal partitioning of total gene family abundances, with haptophyte and ochrophyte genera generally showing the greatest diel partitioning of their transcriptomes. The haptophyte Phaeocystis demonstrated the highest proportion of transcript diel periodicity, while most other protists had intermediate levels of periodicity regardless of their trophic status. Dinoflagellates, except for the parasitoid genus Amoebophrya, exhibit the fewest diel oscillations of transcript abundances. Diel-regulated gene families were enriched in key metabolic pathways; photosynthesis, carbon fixation, and fatty acid biosynthesis gene families had peak times concentrated around dawn, while gene families involved in protein turnover (proteasome and protein processing) are most active during the high intensity daylight hours. TCA cycle, oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid degradation predominantly peaked near dusk. We identified temporal pathway enrichments unique to certain taxa, including assimilatory sulfate reduction at dawn in dictyophytes and signaling pathways at early evening in haptophytes, pointing to possible taxon-specific channels of carbon and nutrients through the microbial community. These results illustrate the synchrony of transcriptional regulation to the diel cycle and how the protist community of the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre structures their transcriptomes to guide the daily flux of matter and energy through the gyre ecosystem.},

Here we describe diatom community composition in the eastern Line P transect, including the coastal-HNLC transition zone, with a method using high-throughput sequencing of diatom 18S gene amplicons. We identified significant correlations between shifting diatom community composition and longitude combined with concentrations of dissolved copper and 2 other dissolved trace metals (dissolved Fe [dFe] and/or dissolved zinc) and/or a physical factor (salinity or density). None of these variables on its own was significantly correlated with shifts in community composition, and 3 of the factors (dFe, salinity, and density) correlated with one another. Longitude could incorporate multiple factors that may influence diatom communities, including distance from shore, proximity of sampling stations, and an integration of previous pulses of macro- and micro-nutrients. We also evaluated in situ Fe limitation of the diatom Thalassiosira oceanica using a quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction method, and found biological evidence of Fe stress in samples from the coastal-HNLC transition zone. Combined, our results support a prior hypothesis that dissolved trace metals as well as longitudinal distance may be important to diatom diversity in the coastal-HNLC transition zone of the Line P transect.},

	abstract = {Ferroproteins arose early in Earth’s history, prior to the emergence of oxygenic photosynthesis and the subsequent reduction of bioavailable iron. Today, iron availability limits primary productivity in about 30\% of the world’s oceans. Diatoms, responsible for nearly half of oceanic primary production, have evolved molecular strategies for coping with variable iron concentrations. Our understanding of the evolutionary breadth of these strategies has been restricted by the limited number of species for which molecular sequence data is available. To uncover the diversity of strategies marine diatoms employ to meet cellular iron demands, we analyzed 367 newly released marine microbial eukaryotic transcriptomes, which include 47 diatom species. We focused on genes encoding proteins previously identified as having a role in iron management: iron uptake (high-affinity ferric reductase, multi-copper oxidase, and Fe(III) permease); iron storage (ferritin); iron-induced protein substitutions (flavodoxin/ferredoxin, and plastocyanin/cytochrome c6) and defense against reactive oxygen species (superoxide dismutases). Homologs encoding the high-affinity iron uptake system components were detected across the four diatom Classes suggesting an ancient origin for this pathway. Ferritin transcripts were also detected in all Classes, revealing a more widespread utilization of ferritin throughout diatoms than previously recognized. Flavodoxin and plastocyanin transcripts indicate possible alternative redox metal strategies. Predicted localization signals for ferredoxin identify multiple examples of gene transfer from the plastid to the nuclear genome. Transcripts encoding four superoxide dismutase metalloforms were detected, including a putative nickel-coordinating isozyme. Taken together, our results suggest that the majority of iron metabolism genes in diatoms appear to be vertically inherited with functional diversity achieved via possible neofunctionalization of paralogs. This refined view of iron use strategies in diatoms elucidates the history of these adaptations, and provides potential molecular markers for determining the iron nutritional status of different diatom species in environmental samples.},

Polymerase chain reaction amplification of two dinucleotide microsatellite loci using DNA extracted from single cell isolates was sensitive enough to identify genetically distinct clones. Each of four culture collection isolates was genetically distinct. Moreover, 23 of 24 isolates obtained from the Hood Canal Basin in Puget Sound, Washington, displayed unique genotypes. The gene diversity of the field isolates is 0.88, indicating that the D. brightwellii population was composed predominantly of unrelated individuals. Maximum growth rates were measured for eight genetically distinct field isolates that were maintained at three light intensities. The growth rates of the isolates differed significantly, indicating that high levels of physiological variability also existed within the population. The results of this study indicate that both extensive genetic and physiological diversity can exist within diatom populations isolated from a single geographical locale at a single time. The observed high levels of diversity are hypothesized to result from the exposure of individual diatom cells to a constantly changing environment and thus to changing selection pressures. The extensive physiological and genetic diversity documented here may help explain how diatoms are able to bloom under a wide range of environmental conditions.},

	abstract = {Iron (Fe) is an important growth factor for diatoms and its availability is further restricted by changes in the carbonate chemistry of seawater. We investigated the physiological attributes and transcriptional profiles of the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana grown on a day: night cycle under different CO2/pH and iron concentrations, that in combination generated available iron (Fe’) concentrations of 1160, 233, 58 and 12 pM. We found the light-dark conditions to be the main driver of transcriptional patterns, followed by Fe’ concentration and CO2 availability, respectively. At the highest Fe’ (1160 pM), 55\% of the transcribed genes were differentially expressed between day and night, whereas at the lowest Fe’ (12 pM), only 28\% of the transcribed genes displayed comparable patterns. While Fe limitation disrupts the diel expression patterns for genes in most central metabolism pathways, the diel expression of light- signaling molecules and glycolytic genes was relatively robust in response to reduced Fe’. Moreover, we identified a non-canonical splicing of transcripts encoding triose-phosphate isomerase, a key-enzyme of glycolysis, generating transcript isoforms that would encode proteins with and without an active site. Transcripts that encoded an active enzyme maintained a diel expression at low Fe’, while transcripts that encoded the non-active enzyme lost the diel expression. This work illustrates the interplay between nutrient limitation and transcriptional regulation over the diel cycle. Considering that future ocean conditions will reduce the availability of Fe in many parts of the oceans, our work identifies some of the regulatory mechanisms that may shape future ecological communities.},

This is the first report of ferritin in any member of the Stramenopila, the eukaryote lineage that includes many plankton components including unicellular algae, diatoms and macroalgae.

The effects of bacteria and bacteria-produced compounds on diatoms range from synergistic to pathogenic and can affect the physiology and transcriptional patterns of the interacting diatom. Here, we investigate physiological and transcriptional changes in the marine diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana induced by extracellular metabolites of a known antagonistic bacterium Croceibacter atlanticus. Mono-cultures of C. atlanticus released compounds that inhibited diatom cell division and elicited a distinctive morphology of enlarged cells with increased chloroplast content and enlarged nuclei, similar to what was previously observed when the diatom was co-cultured with live bacteria. The extracellular C. atlanticus metabolites induced transcriptional changes in diatom pathways that include recognition and signaling pathways, cell cycle regulation, carbohydrate and amino acid production, as well as cell wall stability. Phenotypic analysis showed a disruption in the diatom cell cycle progression and an increase in both intra- and extracellular carbohydrates in diatom cultures after bacterial exudate treatment. The transcriptional changes and corresponding phenotypes suggest that extracellular bacterial metabolites, produced independently of direct bacterial-diatom interaction, may modulate diatom metabolism in ways that support bacterial growth.},

	abstract = {The capability of flow cytometry for rapid quantitative observations of individual cells has made it an important tool in plankton research since the mid-1980s. One indication of the impact of flow cytometry has been the appearance of special journal issues focused on applications in aquatic sciences (Cytometry, Yentsch and Horan 1989; Scientia Marina, Reckermann and Colijn 2000; Cytometry, Courties and Troussellier 2001). Since these publications, major advances have been made in in situ applications and in new approaches enabled by molecular and genomic techniques. In this chapter we provide a brief overview of the history of flow cytometry in plankton research, summarize basic measurement principles and review specific applications, and conclude with an assessment of some emerging areas and future prospects. We stress uses that depend on inherent fluorescence characteristics, with some related reference to uses involving fluorescent markers, stains or probes. Because a number of previous reviews and methodology guides are available (e.g., Chisholm et al. 1986; Legendre and Yentsch 1989; Yentsch and Horan 1989; Burkhill and Mantoura 1990; Olson et al. 1991, 1993; Troussellier et al. 1993; Collier and Campbell 1999; Collier 2000; Veldhuis and Kraay 2000; Vives-Rego et al. 2000; Campbell 2001; Legendre et al. 2001; Marie et al. 2005), our primary focus will be on recent and forward-looking approaches.},

Three genetically distinct populations were detected that were characterized by different microsatellite allele distributions and unique alleles. Isolates from the two most genetically diverged populations displayed identical full-length 18S rDNA sequences suggesting that either a single or two recently diverged species were sampled. The extent of genetic differentiation between populations was not correlated with distance between water samples or time between sampling. Instead, distinct populations were associated with different estuaries. In Puget Sound waters, one population was detected three times over the course of 28 months. Cells from this population were likely maintained inside Puget Sound over long periods through water recirculation within the Sound. In Strait of Juan de Fuca waters, two additional populations were detected. Maximum growth rates of Puget Sound isolates were significantly different from Strait of Juan de Fuca isolates, indicating that populations were composed of cells with different physiological capabilities. The genetic and physiological differentiation observed between populations from intermixing estuaries suggested that genetic exchange between populations was restricted through differential selection. Despite the potential for widespread dispersal in planktonic organisms, it appears that populations with distinct genetic and physiological characteristics can be maintained over long time periods through a combination of hydrology and differential selection.},

The four central rearranged segments of the loci were found to contain both housekeeping genes (expressed during several life-cycle stages) and mating-related genes, while the sequences unique to mt+ or mt− carried genes expressed only in the gametic or zygotic phases of the life cycle. One of these genes, Mtd1, is a candidate participant in gametic cell fusion; two others, Mta1 and Ezy2, are candidate participants in the uniparental inheritance of chloroplast DNA. The identified housekeeping genes include Pdk, encoding pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, and GdcH, encoding glycine decarboxylase complex subunit H. Unusual genetic configurations include three genes whose sequences overlap, one gene that has inserted into the coding region of another, several genes that have been inactivated by rearrangements in the region, and genes that have undergone tandem duplication.

	abstract = {Diatoms are unicellular photosynthetic algae known to secrete organic matter that fuels secondary production in the ocean, though our knowledge of how their physiology impacts the composition of dissolved organic matter remains limited. Like all photosynthetic organisms, their use of light for energy and reducing power creates the challenge of avoiding cellular damage. To better understand the interplay between redox balance and organic matter secretion, we reconstructed a genome-scale metabolic model of Thalassiosira pseudonana strain CCMP 1335, a model for diatom molecular biology and physiology, with a 60-year history of studies. The model simulates the metabolic activities of 1,432 genes via a network of 2,792 metabolites produced through 6,079 reactions distributed across six subcellular compartments. Growth was simulated under different steady-state light conditions (5–200 μmol photons m-2 s-1) and in a batch culture progressing from exponential growth to nitrate-limitation and nitrogen-starvation. We used the model to examine the dissipation of reductants generated through light-dependent processes and found that when available, nitrate assimilation is an important means of dissipating reductants in the plastid; under nitrate-limiting conditions, sulfate assimilation plays a similar role. The use of either nitrate or sulfate uptake to balance redox reactions leads to the secretion of distinct organic nitrogen and sulfur compounds. Such compounds can be accessed by bacteria in the surface ocean. The model of the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana provides a mechanistic explanation for the production of ecologically and climatologically relevant compounds that may serve as the basis for intricate, cross-kingdom microbial networks. Diatom metabolism has an important influence on global biogeochemistry; metabolic models of marine microorganisms link genes to ecosystems and may be key to integrating molecular data with models of ocean biogeochemistry.},

	abstract = {The ubiquitous marine bacterium Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a leading cause of illness associated with seafood consumption. The emergence of two genetically distinct ecotypes (ST3 and ST36) has led to an alarming increase in the size and frequency of disease outbreaks. We conducted a genomic comparison of 30 V. parahaemolyticus genomes that represent a diverse collection of 15 genetically distinct ecotypes, including newly sequenced representatives of ST3 and ST36, isolated from both clinical and environmental sources. A multistep evolutionary analysis showed that genes associated with sensing and responding to environmental stimuli have evolved under positive selection, identifying examples of convergent evolution between ST3 and ST36. A comparison of predicted proteomes indicated that ST3 and ST36 ecotypes laterally acquired tens of novel genes associated with a variety of functions including dormancy, homeostasis and membrane transport. Genes identified in this study play an apparent role in environmental fitness and may confer cross protection against stressors encountered in the human host. Together, these results show the evolution of stress response is an important genetic mechanism correlated with the recent emergence of the ST3 and ST36 ecotypes.},

Here, we investigate the diversity, abundance, and activity of diazotrophic microorganisms in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG), a diazotrophic habitat, and the North Pacific Transition Zone (NPTZ), a region characterized by strong physical, chemical, and biological gradients. Samples were collected on two springtime meridional cruises during 2016 and 2017, spanning from 23.5°N to 41.4°N along 158°W. We observed an abrupt decrease in diazotrophic abundances near the southern edge of the NPTZ, which coincided with a salinity front and with a ∼10-fold increase in Synechococcus abundance, but without a concomitant change in phosphate or nitrate concentrations. In NPSG waters south of this diazotrophic boundary, nifH genes and NFRs were consistently detected and diazotrophic communities were dominated by UCYN-A, an uncultivated, symbiotic cyanobacterium (2.8 × 103 to 1.0 × 106 nifH gene copies L−1). There was a significant positive relationship between quantitative polymerase chain reaction-derived UCYN-A nifH gene abundances and community NFRs in the NPSG, suggesting a large contribution of UCYN-A to community NFRs. In the NPTZ waters to the north, NFRs were low or undetected and nifH genes were rare, with the few detected sequences represented by UCYN-A and noncyanobacterial diazotrophs. The patterns we observed in UCYN-A abundance in the context of local biogeochemistry suggest that the environmental controls of this organism may differ from those of cultivated marine cyanobacterial diazotrophs.},

As a component of labile organic matter, GBT has complex biochemical potential as a substrate for microbial use that is unconstrained in the environment. Here we determine the uptake kinetics and metabolic fate of GBT in two natural microbial communities in the North Pacific characterized by different nitrate concentrations. Dissolved GBT had maximum uptake rates of 0.36 and 0.56 nM h−1 with half-saturation constants of 79 and 11 nM in the high nitrate and low nitrate stations respectively. During multiday incubations, most GBT taken into cells was retained as a compatible solute. Stable isotopes derived from the added GBT were also observed in other metabolites, including choline, carnitine and sarcosine, suggesting that GBT was used for biosynthesis and for catabolism to pyruvate and ammonium. Where nitrate was scarce, GBT was primarily metabolized via demethylation to glycine. Gene transcript data were consistent with SAR11 using GBT as a source of methyl groups to fuel the methionine cycle. Where nitrate concentrations were higher, more GBT was partitioned for lipid biosynthesis by both bacteria and eukaryotic phytoplankton. Our data highlight unexpected metabolic pathways and potential routes of microbial metabolite exchange.},

Photosynthetic marine picoeukaryotes in the genus Micromonas thrive in ecosystems ranging from tropical to polar and could serve as sentinel organisms for biogeochemical fluxes of modern oceans during climate change. These broadly distributed primary producers belong to an anciently diverged sister clade to land plants. Although Micromonas isolates have high 18S ribosomal RNA gene identity, we found that genomes from two isolates shared only 90\% of their predicted genes. Their independent evolutionary paths were emphasized by distinct riboswitch arrangements as well as the discovery of intronic repeat elements in one isolate, and in metagenomic data, but not in other genomes. Divergence appears to have been facilitated by selection and acquisition processes that actively shape the repertoire of genes that are mutually exclusive between the two isolates differently than the core genes. Analyses of the Micromonas genomes offer valuable insights into ecological differentiation and the dynamic nature of early plant evolution.},

Despite their relatively low abundances in the indigenous phytoplankton assemblage, Pseudo-nitzschia species richness is high. The morphometric characteristics of five oceanic Pseudo-nitzschia isolates from at least four species are described using SEM and TEM. The species identified are Pseudo-nitzschia dolorosa Lundholm et Moestrup, P. granii Hasle, P. heimii Manguin, and P. cf. turgidula (Hust.) Hasle. Additional support for the taxonomic classifications based on frustule morphology is provided through the sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) rDNA. Pseudo-nitzschia species identification was also assessed by the construction of ITS1 clone libraries and using automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) for environmental samples collected during the Subarctic Ecosystem Response to Iron Enrichment Study (SERIES), conducted in close proximity to OSP in July of 2002. Based on ITS1 sequences, the presence of P. granii, P. heimii, P. cf. turgidula, and at least five other putative, unidentified Pseudo-nitzschia ITS1 variants was confirmed within iron-enriched phytoplankton assemblages at OSP. None of the oceanic isolates produced detectable levels of particulate domoic acid (DA) when in prolonged stationary phase due to silicic acid starvation. The lack of detectable concentrations of DA suggests that either these strains produce very little or no toxin, or that the physiological conditions required to promote particulate DA production were not met and thus differ from their coastal, toxigenic congeners.},

The first whole-genome sequence from a diatom species, Thalassiosira pseudonana Hasle et Heimdal, was recently reported, and features that are central to diatom physiology and ecology, such as silicon and nitrogen metabolism, iron uptake, and carbon concentration mechanisms, were described. Following this initial study, the basic cellular systems controlling cell signaling, gene expression, cytoskeletal structures, and response to stress have been cataloged in an attempt to obtain a global view of the molecular foundations that sustain such an ecologically successful group of organisms. Comparative analysis with several microbial, plant, and metazoan complete genome sequences allowed the identification of putative membrane receptors, signaling proteins, and other components of central interest to diatom ecophysiology and evolution. Thalassiosira pseudonana likely perceives light through a novel phytochrome and several cryptochrome photoreceptors; it may lack the conserved RHO small-GTPase subfamily of cell-polarity regulators, despite undergoing polarized cell-wall synthesis; and it possesses an unusually large number of heat-shock transcription factors, which may indicate the central importance of transcriptional responses to environmental stress. The availability of the complete gene repertoire will permit a detailed biochemical and genetic analysis of how diatoms prosper in aquatic environments and will contribute to the understanding of eukaryotic evolution.},

Plasmid rescue was used to clone a genomic fragment containing transforming DNA. This fragment was then used to identify the wild-type copy of the gene disrupted during mutagenesis. The wild-type gene is transcribed during all stages of the life cycle and, based on sequence similarity, encodes a P2-type proton transporting ATPase. The gene is referred to as Pmh1 for plasma membrane H+-ATPase. PMH1 displays the greatest sequence similarity to ATPases from two parasitic flagellates and a raphidophytic alga but not to the ATPase from a closely related green alga.

A PCR-based cDNA subtraction technique was used to identify genes that are expressed as small cells of the centric diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii initiate gametogenesis. Ten genes that are up-regulated during the early stages of sexual reproduction have been identified thus far. Three of the sexually induced genes, Sig1, Sig2, andSig3, were sequenced to completion and are members of a novel gene family. The three polypeptides encoded by these genes possess different molecular masses and charges but display many features in common: they share five highly conserved domains; they each contain three or more cysteine-rich epithelial growth factor (EGF)-like repeats; and they each display homology to the EGF-like region of the vertebrate extracellular matrix glycoprotein tenascin X. Interestingly, the five conserved domains appear in the same order in each polypeptide but are separated by variable numbers of nonconserved amino acids. SIG1 and SIG2 display putative regulatory domains within the nonconserved regions. A calcium-binding, EF-hand motif is found in SIG1, and an ATP/GTP binding motif is present in SIG2. The striking similarity between the SIG polypeptides and extracellular matrix components commonly involved in cell-cell interactions suggests that the SIG polypeptides may play a role in sperm-egg recognition. The SIG polypeptides are thus important molecular targets for determining when and where sexual reproduction occurs in the field.},

The primers were used to generate environmental clone libraries from Puget Sound, Washington, and Vancouver Island, British Columbia, to confirm that the primers were specific for Pseudo-nitzschia and to determine the extent of ITS1 sequence diversity within individual species. All environmental ITS1 sequences generated with PnAll primers displayed the greatest similarity to known Pseudo-nitzschia ITS1 sequences. The length of cloned ITS1 fragments differed among species but was conserved within a species. Intraspecific genotypes exhibited {\textless}3\% sequence divergence for seven of the 10 species detected in clone libraries. Several ITS1 genotypes unique to the Pacific Northwest were identified in environmental samples, and other genotypes were more broadly distributed. The Pseudo-nitzschia primers were also used to develop an automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) to rapidly identify Pseudo-nitzschia species in environmental samples based on species-specific variation in the length of the targeted ITS1 region. The ARISA peaks were then associated with the environmental clone sequences for Pseudo-nitzschia species. Surveying the genetic composition of communities at both the inter- and intraspecific levels will enhance our understanding of Pseudo-nitzschia bloom dynamics.},

	abstract = {The enormous species diversity of diatoms correlates with the remarkable range of cell sizes in this group. Nuclear DNA content relates fundamentally to cell volume in other eukaryotic cells. The relationship of cell volume to G1 DNA content was determined among selected members of the genus Thalassiosira, one of the most species-rich and well-studied centric diatom genera. Both minimum and maximum species-specific cell volume correlated positively with G1 DNA content. Phylogeny based on 5.8 S and ITS rDNA sequences indicated that multiple changes in G1 DNA content and cell volume occurred in Thalassiosira evolution, leading to a 1,000-fold range in both parameters in the group. Within the Thalassiosira weissflogii (Grunow) G. A. Fryxell et Grunow species complex, G1 DNA content varied 3-fold: differences related to geographic origin and time since isolation; doubling and tripling of G1 DNA content occurred since isolation in certain T. weissflogii isolates; and subcultures of T. weissflogii CCMP 1336 diverged in DNA content by 50\% within 7 years of separation. Actin, β-tubulin, and Spo11/TopVIA genes were selected for quantitative PCR estimation of haploid genome size in subclones of selected T. weissflogii isolates because they occur only once in the T. pseudonana Hasle et Heimdal genome. Comparison of haploid genome size estimates with G1 DNA content suggested that the most recent T. weissflogii isolate was diploid, whereas other T. weissflogii isolates appeared to be polyploid and/or aneuploid. Aberrant meiotic and mitotic cell divisions were observed, which might relate to polyploidization. The structural flexibility of diatom genomes has important implications for their evolutionary diversification and stability during laboratory maintenance.},

	abstract = {A microcosm nutrient-amendment experiment using central equatorial Pacific Ocean (0°, 140°W) mixed-layer waters was conducted to determine biogeochemical controls on phytoplankton with an emphasis on post-iron enrichment nutrient uptake dynamics and species composition. The addition of either Fe (termed Fe-only) or Fe and Si(OH)4 (termed FeSi) to on-deck incubations resulted in growth primarily of pennate diatoms, with statistically equivalent increases relative to the control in maximum photochemical efficiency, chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations, particulate organic carbon and nitrogen concentrations, and dissolved inorganic carbon uptake rates. In contrast, at peak Chl a concentrations, there was a 3.4-fold higher abundance of large diatoms and a 3.9- fold lower abundance of small pennate diatoms in FeSi relative to Fe-only, which translated into a 3.5-fold higher Si(OH)4 uptake rate and a 2.1-fold higher biogenic silica concentration. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicated that relative to cells from Fe-only, cells from FeSi possessed the lowest protein : carbohydrate ratios, and ratios of lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates relative to silica, consistent with differences in diatom C allocation or increased silicification or both. Our results suggest that after Fe addition, diatom organic matter accumulation rates (i.e., C and N uptake rates) are enhanced but the low, ambient [Si(OH)4] retards cell division rates, resulting in fewer large diatoms with relatively high C and N contents. After the simultaneous addition of Fe and Si(OH)4, enhanced rates of diatom organic matter accumulation and cell division results in more large, heavily silicified diatoms with relatively low C and N contents.},

The lava-impacted seawater was characterized by high concentrations of metals and nutrients that stimulated phytoplankton growth, resulting in an extensive plume of chlorophyll a that was detectable by satellite. Chemical and molecular evidence revealed that this biological response hinged on unexpectedly high concentrations of nitrate, despite the negligible quantities of nitrogen in basaltic lava. We hypothesize that the high nitrate was caused by buoyant plumes of nutrient-rich deep waters created by the substantial input of lava into the ocean. This large-scale ocean fertilization was therefore a unique perturbation event that revealed how marine ecosystems respond to exogenous inputs of nutrients.},

	abstract = {Theoretical studies predict that competition for limited resources reduces biodiversity to the point of ecological instability, whereas strong predator/prey interactions enhance the number of coexisting species and limit fluctuations in abundances. In open ocean ecosystems, competition for low availability of essential nutrients results in relatively few abundant microbial species. The remarkable stability in overall cell abundance of the dominant photosynthetic cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus is assumed to reflect a simple food web structure strongly controlled by grazers and/or viruses. This hypothesized link between stability and ecological interactions, however, has been difficult to test with open ocean microbes because sampling methods commonly have poor temporal and spatial resolution. Here we use continuous techniques on two different winter-time cruises to show that Prochlorococcus cell production and mortality rates are tightly synchronized to the day/night cycle across the subtropical Pacific Ocean. In warmer waters, we observed harmonic oscillations in cell production and mortality rates, with a peak in mortality rate consistently occurring ∼6 h after the peak in cell production. Essentially no cell mortality was observed during daylight. Our results are best explained as a synchronized two-component trophic interaction with the per-capita rates of Prochlorococcus consumption driven either directly by the day/night cycle or indirectly by Prochlorococcus cell production. Light-driven synchrony of food web dynamics in which most of the newly produced Prochlorococcus cells are consumed each night likely enforces ecosystem stability across vast expanses of the open ocean.},

	abstract = {Maintenance of genetic diversity in eukaryotic microbes reflects a synergism between reproductive mode (asexual vs. sexual) and environmental conditions. We determined clonal diversity in field samples of the planktonic marine diatom, Ditylum brightwellii, during a bloom, when cell number increased by seven-fold because of rapid asexual division. The genotypes at three microsatellite loci were determined for 607 individual cell lines isolated during the 11 days of sampling. Genetic diversity remained high during the bloom and 87\% of the cells sampled each day were genetically distinct. Sixty-nine clonal lineages were sampled two or more times during the bloom, and two clones were sampled seven times. Based on the frequency of resampled clonal lineages, capture–recapture statistics were used to determine that at least 2400 genetically distinct clonal lineages comprised the bloom population. No significant differences in microsatellite allele frequencies were observed among daily samples indicating that the bloom was comprised of a single population. No sexual stages were observed, although linkage equilibrium at two loci, high levels of allelic and genotypic diversity, and heterozygote deficiencies were all indicative of past sexual reproduction events. At the height of the bloom, a windstorm diluted cell numbers by 51\% and coincided with a change in the frequency distribution of some resampled lineages. The extensive clonal diversity generated through past sexual reproduction events coupled with frequent environmental changes appear to prevent individual clonal lineages from becoming numerically dominant, maintaining genetic diversity and the adaptive potential of the population.},

	abstract = {Phytoplankton transform inorganic carbon into thousands of biomolecules that represent an important pool of fixed carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur in the surface ocean. Metabolite production differs between phytoplankton, and the flux of these molecules through the microbial food web depends on compound-specific bioavailability to members of a wider microbial community. Yet relatively little is known about the diversity or concentration of metabolites within marine plankton. Here, we compare 313 polar metabolites in 21 cultured phytoplankton species and in natural planktonic communities across environmental gradients to show that bulk community metabolomes reflect the chemical composition of the phytoplankton community. We also show that groups of compounds have similar patterns across space and taxonomy, suggesting that the concentrations of these compounds in the environment are controlled by similar sources and sinks. We quantify several compounds in the surface ocean that represent substantial understudied pools of labile carbon. For example, the N-containing metabolite homarine was up to 3\% of particulate carbon and is produced in high concentrations by cultured Synechococcus, and S-containing gonyol accumulated up to 2.5 nM in surface particles and likely originates from dinoflagellates or haptophytes. Our results show that phytoplankton composition directly shapes the carbon composition of the surface ocean. Our findings suggest that in order to access these pools of bioavailable carbon, the wider microbial community must be adapted to phytoplankton community composition.
IMPORTANCE Microscopic phytoplankton transform 100 million tons of inorganic carbon into thousands of different organic compounds each day. The structure of each chemical is critical to its biological and ecosystem function, yet the diversity of biomolecules produced by marine microbial communities remained mainly unexplored, especially small polar molecules which are often considered the currency of the microbial loop. Here, we explore the abundance and diversity of small biomolecules in planktonic communities across ecological gradients in the North Pacific and within 21 cultured phytoplankton species. Our work demonstrates that phytoplankton diversity is an important determinant of the chemical composition of the highly bioavailable pool of organic carbon in the ocean, and we highlight understudied yet abundant compounds in both the environment and cultured organisms. These findings add to understanding of how the chemical makeup of phytoplankton shapes marine microbial communities where the ability to sense and use biomolecules depends on the chemical structure.},

Multimodal size distributions were detected for both species, and synchronous auxosporulation occurred within the smallest size class during a 3-week window. Auxospores and initial cells created a new class of large cells, and cells in the intermediate size classes increased in abundance during auxosporulation. Mating cells of both species were attached to colonies of surf-zone diatoms. Paired gametangia, gametes, zygotes, auxospores, and large initial cells were found. Auxosporulation began first for P. pungens (June 30), apparently once a critical, high cell concentration was reached, followed by P. australis (July 5), when the total Pseudo-nitzschia cell concentration reached 929,000 cells · L−1. Low frequencies of auxosporulation occurred throughout the bloom but increased 4-fold for P. australis and 3-fold for P. pungens when macronutrients were reduced to low levels on July 11. A 2-year life cycle was estimated for P. australis and 3 years for P. pungens, both with annual auxosporulation. Domoic acid (DA) in razor clams reached a maximum of 38 μg DA · g−1 on July 18.

	abstract = {Marine diatoms are important primary producers that thrive in diverse and dynamic environments. They do so, in theory, by sensing changing conditions and adapting their physiology accordingly. Using the model species Thalassiosira pseudonana, we conducted a detailed physiological and transcriptomic survey to measure the recurrent transcriptional changes that characterize typical diatom growth in batch culture. Roughly 40\% of the transcriptome varied significantly and recurrently, reflecting large, reproducible cell-state transitions between four principal states: (i) “dawn,” following 12 h of darkness; (ii) “dusk,” following 12 h of light; (iii) exponential growth and nutrient repletion; and (iv) stationary phase and nutrient depletion. Increases in expression of thousands of genes at the end of the reoccurring dark periods (dawn), including those involved in photosynthesis (e.g., ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase genes rbcS and rbcL), imply large-scale anticipatory circadian mechanisms at the level of gene regulation. Repeated shifts in the transcript levels of hundreds of genes encoding sensory, signaling, and regulatory functions accompanied the four cell-state transitions, providing a preliminary map of the highly coordinated gene regulatory program under varying conditions. Several putative light sensing and signaling proteins were associated with recurrent diel transitions, suggesting that these genes may be involved in light-sensitive and circadian regulation of cell state. These results begin to explain, in comprehensive detail, how the diatom gene regulatory program operates under varying environmental conditions. Detailed knowledge of this dynamic molecular process will be invaluable for new hypothesis generation and the interpretation of genetic, environmental, and metatranscriptomic data from field studies.},

	abstract = {Ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) are now implicated in exerting significant control over the form and availability of reactive nitrogen species in marine environments. Detailed studies of specific metabolic traits and physicochemical factors controlling their activities and distribution have not been well constrained in part due to the scarcity of isolated AOA strains. Here, we report the isolation of two new coastal marine AOA, strains PS0 and HCA1. Comparison of the new strains to Nitrosopumilus maritimus strain SCM1, the only marine AOA in pure culture thus far, demonstrated distinct adaptations to pH, salinity, organic carbon, temperature, and light. Strain PS0 sustained nearly 80\% of ammonia oxidation activity at a pH as low as 5.9, indicating that coastal strains may be less sensitive to the ongoing reduction in ocean pH. Notably, the two novel isolates are obligate mixotrophs that rely on uptake and assimilation of organic carbon compounds, suggesting a direct coupling between chemolithotrophy and organic matter assimilation in marine food webs. All three isolates showed only minor photoinhibition at 15 µE⋅m−2⋅s−1 and rapid recovery of ammonia oxidation in the dark, consistent with an AOA contribution to the primary nitrite maximum and the plausibility of a diurnal cycle of archaeal ammonia oxidation activity in the euphotic zone. Together, these findings highlight an unexpected adaptive capacity within closely related marine group I Archaea and provide new understanding of the physiological basis of the remarkable ecological success reflected by their generally high abundance in marine environments.},

Here, we quantify resilience of Thalassiosira pseudonana in mid-20th century (300 ppm CO2) and future (1000 ppm CO2) conditions that cause ocean acidification, using a stress test that probes its ability to recover from incrementally higher amount of low-dose ultraviolet A (UVA) and B (UVB) radiation and re-initiate growth in day–night cycles, limited by nitrogen. While all cultures eventually collapse, those growing at 300 ppm CO2 succumb sooner. The underlying mechanism for collapse appears to be a system failure resulting from “loss of relational resilience,” that is, inability to adopt physiological states matched to N-availability and phase of the diurnal cycle. Importantly, under elevated CO2 conditions diatoms sustain relational resilience over a longer timeframe, demonstrating increased resilience to future acidified ocean conditions. This stress test framework can be extended to evaluate and predict how various climate change associated stressors may impact microbial community resilience.},

	abstract = {Light fuels photosynthesis and organic matter production by primary producers in the sunlit ocean. The quantity and quality of the organic matter produced influence community function, yet in situ measurements of metabolites, the products of cellular metabolism, over the diel cycle are lacking. We evaluated community-level biochemical consequences of oscillations of light in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre by quantifying 79 metabolites in particulate organic matter from 15 m every 4 h over 8 days. Total particulate metabolite concentration peaked at dusk and represented up to 2\% of total particulate organic carbon (POC). The concentrations of 55/79 (70\%) individual metabolites exhibited significant 24-h periodicity, with daily fold changes from 1.6 to 12.8, often greater than those of POC and flow cytometry-resolvable biomass, which ranged from 1.2 to 2.8. Paired metatranscriptome analysis revealed the taxa involved in production and consumption of a subset of metabolites. Primary metabolites involved in anabolism and redox maintenance had significant 24-h periodicity and diverse organisms exhibited diel periodicity in transcript abundance associated with these metabolites. Compounds with osmotic properties displayed the largest oscillations in concentration, implying rapid turnover and supporting prior evidence of functions beyond cell turgor maintenance. The large daily oscillation of trehalose paired with metatranscriptome and culture data showed that trehalose is produced by the nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium Crocosphaera, likely to store energy for nighttime metabolism. Together, paired measurements of particulate metabolites and transcripts resolve strategies that microbes use to manage daily energy and redox oscillations and highlight dynamic metabolites with cryptic roles in marine microbial ecosystems.
IMPORTANCE Fueled by light, phytoplankton produce the organic matter that supports ocean ecosystems and carbon sequestration. Ocean change impacts microbial metabolism with repercussions for biogeochemical cycling. As the small molecule products of cellular metabolism, metabolites often change rapidly in response to environmental conditions and form the basis of energy and nutrient management and storage within cells. By pairing measurements of metabolites and gene expression in the stratified surface ocean, we reveal strategies of microbial energy management over the day-night cycle and hypothesize that oscillating metabolites are important substrates for dark respiration by phytoplankton. These high-resolution diel measurements of in situ metabolite concentrations form the basis for future work into the specific roles these compounds play in marine microbial communities.},

	abstract = {Isolates of the centric diatom, Thalassiosira weissflogii Grun., were maintained in exponential growth under constant, favorable conditions for nearly 2 years. During this interval, each culture underwent periodic increases and decreases in mean cell size, a behavior predicted for diatom populations alternating between sexual and asexual reproduction, respectively. The overall patterns of cell size change displayed by each culture, however, were unique. The maximum size of newly enlarged cells varied among isolates and within a given isolate over time. Consequently, both the timing and rate of increase in mean cell size also varied despite the fact that the minimum average cell size obtained by the various cultures was relatively constant. The most consistent feature among the isolates was the rate of decrease in mean cell size, a value determined by the physical constraints of the diatom frustule during mitotic divisions. We hypothesize that the extent of the variability exhibited by these cultures results from the fact that an inherent feature of diatom populations is a constantly changing genetic composition.},

	abstract = {The Columbia River estuary is a dynamic system in which estuarine turbidity maxima trap and extend the residence time of particles and particle-attached bacteria over those of the water and free-living bacteria. Particle-attached bacteria dominate bacterial activity in the estuary and are an important part of the estuarine food web. PCR-amplified 16S rRNA genes from particle-attached and free-living bacteria in the Columbia River, its estuary, and the adjacent coastal ocean were cloned, and 239 partial sequences were determined. A wide diversity was observed at the species level within at least six different bacterial phyla, including most subphyla of the classProteobacteria. In the estuary, most particle-attached bacterial clones (75\%) were related to members of the genusCytophaga or of the α, γ, or δ subclass of the classProteobacteria. These same clones, however, were rare in or absent from either the particle-attached or the free-living bacterial communities of the river and the coastal ocean. In contrast, about half (48\%) of the free-living estuarine bacterial clones were similar to clones from the river or the coastal ocean. These free-living bacteria were related to groups of cosmopolitan freshwater bacteria (β-proteobacteria, gram-positive bacteria, andVerrucomicrobium spp.) and groups of marine organisms (gram-positive bacteria and α-proteobacteria [SAR11 andRhodobacter spp.]). These results suggest that rapidly growing particle-attached bacteria develop into a uniquely adapted estuarine community and that free-living estuarine bacteria are similar to members of the river and the coastal ocean microbial communities. The high degree of diversity in the estuary is the result of the mixing of bacterial communities from the river, estuary, and coastal ocean.},

Here, we present laboratory evidence that calcification and net primary production in the coccolithophore species Emiliania huxleyi are significantly increased by high CO2 partial pressures. Field evidence from the deep ocean is consistent with these laboratory conclusions, indicating that over the past 220 years there has been a 40\% increase in average coccolith mass. Our findings show that coccolithophores are already responding and will probably continue to respond to rising atmospheric CO2 partial pressures, which has important implications for biogeochemical modeling of future oceans and climate.},

	abstract = {Phosphate (PO4) is an important limiting nutrient in marine environments. Marine cyanobacteria scavenge PO4 using the high-affinity periplasmic phosphate binding protein PstS. The pstS gene has recently been identified in genomes of cyanobacterial viruses as well. Here, we analyse genes encoding transporters in genomes from viruses that infect eukaryotic phytoplankton. We identified inorganic PO4 transporter-encoding genes from the PHO4 superfamily in several virus genomes, along with other transporter-encoding genes. Homologues of the viral pho4 genes were also identified in genome sequences from the genera that these viruses infect. Genome sequences were available from host genera of all the phytoplankton viruses analysed except the host genus Bathycoccus. Pho4 was recovered from Bathycoccus by sequencing a targeted metagenome from an uncultured Atlantic Ocean population. Phylogenetic reconstruction showed that pho4 genes from pelagophytes, haptophytes and infecting viruses were more closely related to homologues in prasinophytes than to those in what, at the species level, are considered to be closer relatives (e.g. diatoms). We also identified PHO4 superfamily members in ocean metagenomes, including new metagenomes from the Pacific Ocean. The environmental sequences grouped with pelagophytes, haptophytes, prasinophytes and viruses as well as bacteria. The analyses suggest that multiple independent pho4 gene transfer events have occurred between marine viruses and both eukaryotic and bacterial hosts. Additionally, pho4 genes were identified in available genomes from viruses that infect marine eukaryotes but not those that infect terrestrial hosts. Commonalities in marine host-virus gene exchanges indicate that manipulation of host-PO4 uptake is an important adaptation for viral proliferation in marine systems. Our findings suggest that PO4-availability may not serve as a simple bottom-up control of marine phytoplankton.},

	abstract = {Dual-beam flow cytometry was used to analyze the distribution and optical characteristics of Synechococcus in the North Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The depth range over which Synechococcus cells were abundant was related to the depth of the nitrite maximum and the chlorophyll maximum, but was not significantly correlated with the depth of the surface isothermal layer. Dual-beam analysis of chromophore pigment types revealed that the majority of the populations were of the high-urobilin type; low-urobilin types, similar to the isolate WH7803, were found only in coastal waters where they almost always co-occurred with high-urobilin strains. Phycoerythrin fluorescence intensity per cell increased dramatically with depth in the lower euphotic zone at all stations; at some open-ocean stations, very deep cells were as much as 100 times brighter than those at the surface. The maximal fluorescence intensity per cell was about the same at the coastal and oceanic stations, and the depth of maximal fluorescence was closely related to the depth of the nitrite maximum. At most stations, fluorescence per cell was constant throughout the mixed layer, but at some open-ocean stations it decreased continuously to the surface. The latter pattern suggests that mixing rates in these areas are slow relative to the abilities of the cells to photoacclimate. A distinct diel pattern in forward-angle light scatter was observed in cells in the mixed layer over vast regions, which we hypothesize to be coupled to growth of the cells during daylight hours.},

The relation between geography and genetic differentiation was examined for 398 C. pacificus individuals sampled from six widely distributed locations across the North Pacific, including an open ocean site and coastal sites on both sides of the North Pacific basin. For each individual copepod, the DNA sequence was determined for a 421-bp region of the mitochondrial coxI gene (mtCOI). A total of sixty-three different mtCOI sequences, or haplotypes, were detected, with a sequence divergence between haplotypes of 0.2–3.1\%. The number and distribution of haplotypes varied with sampling location; 12 haplotypes were distributed across multiple sampling locations, and 51 occurred at only one location. Five genetically distinct populations were detected based on FST values. Haplotype minimum spanning networks, nucleotide divergence and FST values indicated that individuals from coastal sites in the North Pacific Ocean were more closely related to each other than to individuals from the open ocean site at Station P. These results provide genetic support for the designation of two subspecies—a coastal subspecies that consists of what is currently referred to as C. p. pacificus and C. p. californicus and an open ocean subspecies C. p. oceanicus. This work also indicates that planktonic copepods with potentially high dispersal capacity can develop genetically structured populations in the absence of obvious geographic barriers between proximate locales within an ocean basin.},

Diatoms can form dense blooms through rapid asexual reproduction; mutations acquired and propagated during blooms likely provide the genetic, and thus phenotypic, variability upon which natural selection may act. Positive selection was tested using genome and transcriptome-wide pair-wise comparisons of homologs in three genera of diatoms (Pseudo-nitzschia, Ditylum, and Thalassiosira) that represent decreasing phylogenetic distances. The signal of positive selection was greatest between two strains of Thalassiosira pseudonana. Further testing among seven strains of T. pseudonana yielded 809 candidate genes of positive selection, which are 7\% of the protein-coding genes. Orphan genes and genes encoding protein-binding domains and transcriptional regulators were enriched within the set of positively selected genes relative to the genome as a whole. Positively selected genes were linked to the potential selective pressures of nutrient limitation and sea surface temperature based on analysis of gene expression profiles and identification of positively selected genes in subsets of strains from locations with similar environmental conditions. The identification of positively selected genes presents an opportunity to test new hypotheses in natural populations and the laboratory that integrate selected genotypes in T. pseudonana with their associated phenotypes and selective forces.},

Here we identify the plastid proteomes of two diatoms, Thalassiosira pseudonana and Phaeodactylum tricornutum, using a customized prediction tool (ASAFind) that identifies nuclear-encoded plastid proteins in algae with secondary plastids of the red lineage based on the output of SignalP and the identification of conserved ‘ASAFAP’ motifs and transit peptides. We tested ASAFind against a large reference dataset of diatom proteins with experimentally confirmed subcellular localization and found that the tool accurately identified plastid-localized proteins with both high sensitivity and high specificity. To identify nucleus-encoded plastid proteins of T. pseudonana and P. tricornutum we generated optimized sets of gene models for both whole genomes, to increase the percentage of full-length proteins compared with previous assembly model sets. ASAFind applied to these optimized sets revealed that about 8\% of the proteins encoded in their nuclear genomes were predicted to be plastid localized and therefore represent the putative plastid proteomes of these algae.},

Surprisingly, however, little is known about the impact of sexual events on diatom population dynamics. TheSig1 gene is strongly upregulated during sexual reproduction in the centric diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii and has been hypothesized to encode a protein involved in gamete recognition. In the present study, degenerate PCR primers were designed and used to amplify a portion ofSig1 from three closely related species in the cosmopolitan genus Thalassiosira,Thalassiosira oceanica, Thalassiosira guillardii, andThalassiosira pseudonana. Identification ofSig1 in these three additional species facilitated development of this gene as a molecular marker for diatom sexual events. Examination of the new sequences indicated that multiple copies of Sig1 are probably present in the genome. Moreover, compared to the housekeeping geneβ-tubulin, the Sig1genes of isolates of T. weissflogii collected from different regions of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans displayed high levels of divergence. The Sig1 genes of the four closely related Thalassiosira species also displayed high levels of sequence divergence compared to the levels observed with a second gene, Fcp, probably explaining why Sig1could not be amplified from more distantly related species. The high levels of sequence divergence both within and between species suggest that Sig1 is rapidly evolving in a manner reminiscent of the manner observed in other genes that encode gamete recognition proteins. A simple model is presented for Sig1 evolution and the implications of such a rapidly evolving sexual reproduction gene for diatom speciation and population dynamics.},

Here, "weakly structured" means tabular, rows-and-columns datasets that share some common context, but that have limited a priori agreement on file formats, relationships, types, schemas, metadata, or semantics. In this case study, the data were acquired from hundreds of distinct locations during a multi-day oceanographic cruise using a variety of physical, biological, and chemical sensors and assays. Months after the cruise when preliminary data processing was complete, 40+ researchers from a variety of disciplines participated in a two-day "data synthesis workshop." At this workshop, two computer scientists used a web-based query-as-a-service platform called SQLShare to perform "SQL stenography": capturing the scientific discussion in real time to integrate data, test hypotheses, and populate visualizations to then inform and enhance further discussion. In this "field test" of our technology and approach, we found that it was not only feasible to support interactive science Q\&A with essentially pure SQL, but that we significantly increased the value of the "face time" at the meeting: researchers from different fields were able to validate assumptions and resolve ambiguity about each others' fields. As a result, new science emerged from a meeting that was originally just a planning meeting. In this paper, we describe the details of this experiment, discuss our major findings, and lay out a new research agenda for collaborative science database services.},

Early studies conceptualized this link as the passive addition and removal of organic compounds from a shared seawater reservoir. Here, we analysed transcript and intracellular metabolite patterns in a two-member model system and found that the presence of a heterotrophic bacterium induced a potential recognition cascade in a marine phytoplankton species that parallels better-understood vascular plant response systems. Bacterium Ruegeria pomeroyi DSS-3 triggered differential expression of {\textgreater}80 genes in diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana CCMP1335 that are homologs to those used by plants to recognize external stimuli, including proteins putatively involved in leucine-rich repeat recognition activity, second messenger production and protein kinase cascades. Co-cultured diatoms also downregulated lipid biosynthesis genes and upregulated chitin metabolism genes. From differential expression of bacterial transporter systems, we hypothesize that nine diatom metabolites supported the majority of bacterial growth, among them sulfonates, sugar derivatives and organic nitrogen compounds. Similar recognition responses and metabolic linkages as observed in this model system may influence carbon transformations by ocean plankton.},

However, the influence of various abiotic factors in determining their distribution and activity in the upper ocean remain largely unclear. Here, we examined the influence of light, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and temperature on ammonia oxidation rates for communities dominated by Thaumarchaeota at the nitrite maximum across two North Pacific transects. In situ ammonia oxidation was almost exclusively driven by Thaumarchaeota, as inferred from ammonia monooxygenase subunit A (amoA) genes, amoA transcripts, and inhibitor studies. A major shift in population structure near the eastern North Pacific Subtropical Front was revealed by sequence variation of amoA genes, showing different Thaumarchaeota community structure in oligotrophic gyre and temperate regions. While the most dominant OTUs were closely related, we found significant differences in physiological responses to light and temperature of incubation. At four stations in different biogeochemical regimes, the impact of sunlight intensity and temperature on activity was evaluated using 15 -spiked whole seawater collected from the nitrite maximum and incubated at different depths on a free floating in situ array. Ammonia oxidation was usually completely inhibited by PAR at the surface and 21–45\% inhibited at 1\% surface PAR, whereas a temperature effect on ammonia oxidation was observed at only two of four stations. While inhibition due to H2O2 cannot be ruled out in surface waters, our findings show that below the mixed layer, photoinhibition, and not H2O2 toxicity, had a greater influence on ammonia oxidation.},

	abstract = {The influence of the phytoplankton-specific organic compound glycolate on bacterial community structure was examined during the 2004 spring phytoplankton bloom (February to April) in Dabob Bay in Washington. The diversity of the bacteria able to utilize glycolate during the phytoplankton bloom was determined using previously developed PCR primers to amplify the gene for the D subunit of glycolate oxidase (glcD). Many of the glcD sequences obtained represented novel sequences that appeared to be specific to marine environments. Overall, the glcD sequence diversity decreased as the phytoplankton bloom progressed. Phylotype-specific glcD quantitative PCR primers were designed for the six most commonly detected glcD phylotypes that represented distinct phylogenetic groups of heterotrophic bacteria. Three patterns of phylotype abundance were detected: four phylotypes were most abundant during the onset of the bloom; the abundance of one phylotype increased as the bloom progressed; and one phylotype was abundant throughout the bloom. Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR with the same phylotype-specific primers was used to determine the levels of day and night glcD RNA transcription over the course of the bloom. glcD transcripts, when detectable, were always more abundant in the day than at night for each phylotype, suggesting that the bacteria responded to the glycolate produced by phytoplankton during the day. The nearly constant low in situ glycolate concentrations suggested that bacteria rapidly utilized the available glycolate. This study provided evidence for direct phytoplankton-bacterium interactions and the resulting succession in a single functional group of marine bacteria.},

Using flow cytometry to determine the relative DNA and chlorophyll content per cell, the number of cells within a population that responded to and induction signal was measured. From 0 to over 90\% of a population differentiated into male gametes depending upon both the induction trigger and the population examined, regardless of the average cell size of the population. Through the use of synchromized cultures, we demonstrated that responsiveness to an induction trigger was a function of cell cycle stage; cells in early G1 were not yet committed to complete mitosis and were induced to form male gametes, whereas cells further along in their cell cycle were unresponsive to these same cues. A simple model combining the influence of light on the mitotic cell cycle and on the induction of spermatogenesis is proposed to explain the observed diversity in population responses to changes in light conditions.},

The SeaFlow cytometer continuously profiles microbial phytoplankton populations across thousands of kilometers of the surface ocean. The data streams produced by instruments such as SeaFlow challenge the traditional sample-by-sample approach in cytometric analysis and highlight the need for scalable clustering algorithms to extract population information from these large-scale, high-frequency flow cytometers.Results: We explore how available algorithms commonly used for medical applications perform at classification of such a large-scale, environmental flow cytometry data. We apply large-scale Gaussian mixture models to massive datasets using Hadoop. This approach outperforms current state-of-the-art cytometry classification algorithms in accuracy and can be coupled with manual or automatic partitioning of data into homogeneous sections for further classification gains. We propose the Gaussian mixture model with partitioning approach for classification of large-scale, high-frequency flow cytometry data.Availability and Implementation: Source code available for download at https://github.com/jhyrkas/seaflow\_cluster, implemented in Java for use with Hadoop.Contact: hyrkas@cs.washington.eduSupplementary information:  Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {Current automated flow cytometers primarily target the dynamics of phytoplankton communities in coastal environments and lack the sensitivity to resolve the spatial distribution of Prochlorococcus, the smallest phytoplankton that dominates the open ocean. Here we present SeaFlow, a novel flow cytometer developed for continuous real-time observations of natural assemblages of small phytoplankton cells, including Prochlorococcus. Unlike other flow cytometers, SeaFlow does not use sheath fluid. Instead, a virtual-core is used to determine the position of a particle in the stream of seawater. By eliminating sheath fluid, SeaFlow can continuously sample the seawater stream directly from a ship's intake system. Image analysis is used to automatically align the laser with the optical system and then monitor and correct for drift. SeaFlow performs rapid quantification (up to 24,000 cells per second) of multidimensional characteristics of phytoplankton cells in the pico- to nanophytoplankton size range (0.5-20 µm) to analyze the equivalent of 480 traditional flow cytometry samples per day while on board a research vessel. Data analysis tools have been created to automatically cluster and count phytoplankton populations with geo-referenced data visualization. SeaFlow makes it possible to explore surface phytoplankton dynamics at a spatial scale ranging from a few meters to thousands of kilometers. An example data set is presented from a 450-km long transect near the Hawaiian Islands with the continuous data aggregated in 3 min intervals.},

The chlorophyll a concentration increased similarly in communities incubated with added nitrate or both nitrate and silicic acid, indicating that growth was limited by nitrate availability. Communities that grew in the treatment with added silicic acid and nitrate were more silicified than communities in the treatment with only nitrate added. No difference in community composition was detected between these treatments in three out of four experiments. Isolates of Minutocellus, Cylindrotheca, Thalassiosira, and Odontella were obtained from the microcosm experiment conducted in May 2010 and were maintained in the laboratory in 20 µmol L−1 silicic acid. All four diatom isolates contained ∼ 2.5 times more silica per cell when silicic acid concentration in the media was increased to 80 µmol L−1. The intensity of a fluorescent cellular stain of newly precipitated silica (2-(4-pyridyl)-5[4-dimethylaminoethyl-aminocarbamoyl)-methoxy]phenyloxazole) strongly correlated with silica content among species, but was a less sensitive indicator of changing silicification within a single species. Changes in silicification were not correlated with changes in the transcript abundance of silicic acid transporters. Sinking rates increased roughly 2-fold for cells that contained ∼ 2.5 times more silica. Variation in silicic acid supply alters the silicification of nitrate-fueled coastal diatom blooms and the potential sink of carbon from coastal zones.},

	abstract = {High representation by ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) in marine systems is consistent with their high affinity for ammonia, efficient carbon fixation, and copper (Cu)-centric respiratory system. However, little is known about their response to nutrient stress. We therefore used global transcriptional and proteomic analyses to characterize the response of a model AOA, Nitrosopumilus maritimus SCM1, to ammonia starvation, Cu limitation and Cu excess. Most predicted protein-coding genes were transcribed in exponentially growing cells, and of {\textasciitilde}74\% detected in the proteome, {\textasciitilde}6\% were modified by N-terminal acetylation. The general response to ammonia starvation and Cu stress was downregulation of genes for energy generation and biosynthesis. Cells rapidly depleted transcripts for the A and B subunits of ammonia monooxygenase (AMO) in response to ammonia starvation, yet retained relatively high levels of transcripts for the C subunit. Thus, similar to ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, selective retention of amoC transcripts during starvation appears important for subsequent recovery, and also suggests that AMO subunit transcript ratios could be used to assess the physiological status of marine populations. Unexpectedly, cobalamin biosynthesis was upregulated in response to both ammonia starvation and Cu stress, indicating the importance of this cofactor in retaining functional integrity during times of stress.},

The ability to identify open reading frames and thus distinguish between introns and exons, coding and noncoding sequence is essential to move from nuclear DNA sequences to predicted amino acid sequences. To facilitate the identification of open reading frames in T. weissflogii, two newly identified nuclear genes encoding β-tubulin and t -complex polypeptide (TCP)-γ, along with six previously published nuclear DNA sequences, were examined for general structural features. The coding region of the nuclear open reading frames had a G + C content of about 49\% and could readily be distinguished from noncoding sequence due to a significant difference in G + C content. The introns were uniformly small, about 100 base pairs in size. Furthermore, the 5′ and 3′ splice sites of introns displayed the canonical GT/AG sequence, further facilitating recognition of noncoding regions. Six of the nuclear open reading frames displayed relatively little bias in the use of synonymous codons, as exemplified by the cDNAs encoding β-tubulin and TCP-γ. Two open reading frames displayed strong bias in the use of particular codons (although the codons used were different), as exemplified by the cDNA encoding fucoxanthin chlorophyll a/c binding protein. Knowledge of codon bias should facilitate, for example, design of degenerate PCR primers and potential heterologous reporter gene constructs.},

The blooms were comprised of two genetically distinct populations identified by analyzing up to three microsatellite loci from 707 individual cells. One population was detected at all locations from February to April and comprised three blooms. In May and June, it was gone, replaced by a second, genetically distinct population that comprised a different bloom. Both populations had high levels of diversity: on average, 94\% of cells in each sample were genetically distinct. The two populations contained cells with identical 18S and 5.8S rDNA sequences and 1.1\% sequence divergence at the internal transcribed spacer regions, which suggests that both populations were members of the same species. The populations detected in early and late spring were composed of cells with average valve diameters of 22 and 69 mm, respectively. The population sampled in late spring, comprised of large-diameter cells, had a distinct genetic composition, indicating that it did not arise from a sexual reproduction event in the population sampled in early spring. Both populations were associated with significantly different exposures to solar irradiance and silicic acid concentrations, suggesting that environmental selection may regulate bloom dynamics of distinct populations.},

	abstract = {In the surface ocean, phytoplankton transform inorganic substrates into organic matter that fuels the activity of heterotrophic microorganisms, creating intricate metabolic networks that determine the extent of carbon recycling and storage in the ocean. Yet, the diversity of organic molecules and interacting organisms has hindered detection of specific relationships that mediate this large flux of energy and matter. Here, we show that a tightly coupled microbial network based on organic sulfur compounds (sulfonates) exists among key lineages of eukaryotic phytoplankton producers and heterotrophic bacterial consumers in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. We find that cultured eukaryotic phytoplankton taxa produce sulfonates, often at millimolar internal concentrations. These same phytoplankton-derived sulfonates support growth requirements of an open-ocean isolate of the SAR11 clade, the most abundant group of marine heterotrophic bacteria. Expression of putative sulfonate biosynthesis genes and sulfonate abundances in natural plankton communities over the diel cycle link sulfonate production to light availability. Contemporaneous expression of sulfonate catabolism genes in heterotrophic bacteria highlights active cycling of sulfonates in situ. Our study provides evidence that sulfonates serve as an ecologically important currency for nutrient and energy exchange between microbial autotrophs and heterotrophs, highlighting the importance of organic sulfur compounds in regulating ecosystem function.},

Diel oscillations in TAG concentration comprise 23 ± 11\% of primary production by eukaryotic nanophytoplankton representing a global flux of about 2.4 Pg C yr−1. Metatranscriptomic analyses of genes required for TAG biosynthesis indicate that haptophytes and dinoflagellates are active members in TAG production.

	abstract = {Diatoms are photoautotrophic organisms capable of growing on a variety of inorganic and organic nitrogen sources. Discovery of a complete urea cycle in diatoms was surprising, as this pathway commonly functions in heterotrophic organisms to rid cells of waste nitrogen. To determine how the urea cycle is integrated into cellular nitrogen metabolism and energy management, the centric diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana was maintained in semi-continuous batch cultures on nitrate, ammonium, or urea as the sole nitrogen source, under a 16: 8 light: dark cycle and at light intensities that were low, saturating, or high for growth. Steady-state transcript levels were determined for genes encoding enzymes linked to the urea cycle, urea hydrolysis, glutamine synthesis, pyrimidine synthesis, photorespiration, and energy storage. Transcript abundances were significantly affected by nitrogen source, light intensity and a diel cycle. The impact of N source on differential transcript accumulation was most apparent under the highest light intensity. Models of cellular metabolism under high light were developed based on changes in transcript abundance and predicted enzyme localizations. We hypothesize that the urea cycle is integrated into nitrogen metabolism through its connection to glutamine and in the eventual production of urea. These findings have important implications for nitrogen flow in the cell over diel cycles at surface ocean irradiances.},

	abstract = {Diatoms are highly productive single-celled algae that form an intricately patterned silica cell wall after every cell division. They take up and utilize silicic acid from seawater via silicon transporter (SIT) proteins. This study examined the evolution of the SIT gene family to identify potential genetic adaptations that enable diatoms to thrive in the modern ocean. By searching for sequence homologs in available databases, the diversity of organisms found to encode SITs increased substantially and included all major diatom lineages and other algal protists. A bacterial-encoded gene with homology to SIT sequences was also identified, suggesting that a lateral gene transfer event occurred between bacterial and protist lineages. In diatoms, the SIT genes diverged and diversified to produce five distinct clades. The most basal SIT clades were widely distributed across diatom lineages, while the more derived clades were lineage-specific, which together produced a distinct repertoire of SIT types among major diatom lineages. Differences in the predicted protein functional domains encoded among SIT clades suggest that the divergence of clades resulted in functional diversification among SITs. Both laboratory cultures and natural communities changed transcription of each SIT clade in response to experimental or environmental growth conditions, with distinct transcriptional patterns observed among clades. Together, these data suggest that the diversification of SITs within diatoms led to specialized adaptations among diatoms lineages, and perhaps their dominant ability to take up silicic acid from seawater in diverse environmental conditions.},

Here, we use metagenomic analysis of two samples, from a field of frost flowers and the underlying young sea ice, to explore the metabolic potential of this surface ice community. The analysis links genes for key biogeochemical processes to the Rhizobiales, including dimethylsulfide uptake, betaine glycine turnover, and halocarbon production. Nodulation and nitrogen fixation genes characteristic of terrestrial root-nodulating Rhizobiales were generally lacking from these metagenomes. Non-Rhizobiales clades at the ice surface had genes that would enable additional biogeochemical processes, including mercury reduction and dimethylsulfoniopropionate catabolism. Although the ultimate source of the observed microbial community is not known, considerations of the possible role of eolian deposition or transport with particles entrained during ice formation favor a suspended particle source for this microbial community.},

	abstract = {The net balance between photosynthesis and respiration in the surface ocean is a key regulator of ocean-atmosphere carbon dioxide (CO2) partitioning, and by extension, Earth's climate. The slight excess of photosynthesis over community respiration in sunlit waters, known as net community production (NCP), sets the upper bound on the sequestration of carbon via biologically mediated export. Prevailing paradigms suggest a high/low binary where net primary production (NPP), NCP, and export are highest in ecosystems characterized by microplankton ({\textgreater}20 μm) and lowest in ecosystems dominated by picoplankton ({\textless}2 μm). This bifurcation model neglects the potential importance of nanoplankton (2–20 μm)—i.e., the “middle” size class—toward global biological pump functioning. Here, we show a relationship between the biomass of nanoplankton and oxygen-based estimates of NCP across natural ecological gradients in the North Pacific Ocean. Using a suite of high-resolution optical imaging approaches including SeaFlow, Imaging FlowCytobot, and laser-based scattering, nanoplankton dynamics are observed to dominate the particle size distribution throughout an 1,000 km transition between the subtropical and subpolar North Pacific, where NCP rates are threefold to fivefold higher than subtropical values. Based on ecological theory applied to the Darwin size-based ecosystem model, we hypothesize that intermediate size class organisms are capable of high rates of production via an optimization of bottom-up and top-down control inherent to the “middle class.” More broadly, the model indicates the global importance of nanoplankton for ocean biological production.},

	abstract = {The distribution and speciation of copper (Cu) in Hood Canal, a fjord in western Puget Sound, Washington, were studied over a 2-year period. Cu is required as a cofactor for many enzymatic pathways, including ammonia oxidation. In Hood Canal, ammonia oxidation is largely dominated by ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), which have high Cu requirements for other processes as well. Dissolved Cu was slightly depleted in the upper water column, and concentrations were almost unchanged from measurements made in the late 1970s, ranging from 4.08 to 6.12nM. Although this implies that the biological demand is small relative to the large and relatively constant inventory of dissolved Cu, and that Cu limitation is therefore unlikely to influence rates of biological processes, speciation measurements indicated that dissolved Cu is strongly complexed by organic ligands. As a result, bioavailable Cu2+ concentrations were considerably lower, varying from 6.14×10–15M to 1.36×10–12M. This is a range that encompasses the threshold ({\textless}{\textasciitilde}2×10–13M) for Cu limitation of ammonia oxidation by Nitrosopumilus maritimus SCM1, a representative AOA, in culture (Amin et al., 2013). Furthermore, Cu2+ displayed a clear trend over most sampling periods, with Cu2+ concentrations one to two orders of magnitude higher below 20m in the deeper, saline waters, and exhibiting minima in the upper 15m. The major freshwater input to Hood Canal is not an important source of ligands, which suggests that the ligands are likely produced biologically in the water column and have slow turnover times. In general, ammonia oxidation rates varied considerably but were lowest in the upper water column where Cu2+ concentrations were also lowest. Thus, these findings will facilitate further work to ascertain the relative importance of Cu bioavailability in limiting ammonia oxidation rates versus light inhibition, which has frequently been invoked to account for low rates of nitrification in the upper water column.},

	abstract = {A microcosm study in iron-limited waters of the northeast subarctic Pacific Ocean was conducted to examine how iron availability affects the frustule-related response of individual diatoms and thus the total quantity of silica precipitated by the community. New silica precipitated per cell was estimated using the fluorescent cell stain 2-(4-pyridyl)-5[4-dimethylaminoethyl-aminocarbamoyl)-methoxy]phenyloxazole (PDMPO). Differences in new silica precipitation within a particular genus before and after iron enrichment were small compared to differences among genera, indicating that the quantity of total silica precipitated is particularly sensitive to community composition. Transcriptional patterns of genes encoding silicon transporters, aminopropyltransferases, chitin synthases, and a protein with uncharacterized function were measured in natural populations to identify indicators of the frustule-related responses of different genera to iron limitation. Transcripts associated with silicon transporters were the most readily detectable in three metatranscriptome datasets and were capable of resolving species composition shifts and physiological responses. Silicon transporter transcripts from a distinct phylogenetic clade were most abundant in the iron-limited community, and transcripts from a separate clade were more abundant in the community that bloomed after iron enrichment. Transcripts of the gene present in the iron-limited community were also more abundant in iron-limited laboratory cultures of Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries, suggesting that this gene plays a role in silicon uptake during iron limitation. The responses of individual cells, as detected in this study, determine how the community influences silicon cycling in iron-limited environments.},

However, the ecological dynamics that drive regions of intense productivity and carbon export are poorly understood. In this study, we present high-spatial-resolution estimates of air-sea CO2 flux, net community production (NCP) rates calculated from O2/Ar ratios, and phytoplankton population abundances determined by continuous underway measurements on a cruise across the Gulf of Alaska in May 2010. The highest rates of NCP (79.2 ± 13 mmol C m-2 d-1) and oceanic CO2 uptake (air-sea flux of −14.7 ± 2.4 mmol C m-2 d-1) were observed across a transition zone between the high-nitrate low-chlorophyll (HNLC) waters of the Alaskan Gyre and the coastal waters off the Aleutian Islands. While the transition zone comprises 20\% of the total area covered in crossing the Gulf of Alaska, it contributed 49\% of the total NCP and 48\% of the total CO2 uptake observed along the cruise track. A corresponding transition zone phytoplankton bloom was dominated by two small-celled ({\textless}20 µm) phytoplankton communities, which were distinct from the phytoplankton communities in the surrounding Alaskan Gyre and coastal waters. We hypothesize that mixing between iron-rich coastal waters and iron-limited Alaskan Gyre waters stimulated this bloom and fueled the high NCP and CO2 export observed in the region.},

Recent studies indicate a significant contribution of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) to nitrification. However, quantification of the relative contributions of AOA and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) to in situ ammonia oxidation remains challenging. We show here the production of nitric oxide (NO) by Nitrosopumilus maritimus SCM1. Activity of SCM1 was always associated with the release of NO with quasi-steady state concentrations between 0.05 and 0.08 μM. NO production and metabolic activity were inhibited by the nitrogen free radical scavenger 2-phenyl-4,4,5,5,-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (PTIO). Comparison of marine and terrestrial AOB strains with SCM1 and the recently isolated marine AOA strain HCA1 demonstrated a differential sensitivity of AOB and AOA to PTIO and allylthiourea (ATU). Similar to the investigated AOA strains, bulk water column nitrification at coastal and open ocean sites with sub-micromolar ammonia/ammonium concentrations was inhibited by PTIO and insensitive to ATU. These experiments support predictions from kinetic, molecular and biogeochemical studies, indicating that marine nitrification at low ammonia/ammonium concentrations is largely driven by archaea and suggest an important role of NO in the archaeal metabolism.},

	abstract = {Diatoms are among the most diverse groups of phytoplankton in the ocean. Despite their widely recognized influence on ocean ecosystems and global biogeochemistry, little is known about the impact of this diversity on large-scale processes. Here, we examined the ramifications of between-species diversity by documenting the transcriptional response of three diatoms —Thalassiosira pseudonana, Fragilariopsis cylindrus, and Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries —to the onset of nitrate limitation of growth, a common limiting nutrient in the ocean. The three species shared 5583 clusters of orthologous genes based on OrthoMCL clustering of publically available diatom genomes. These clusters represent 30–54\% of the predicted genes in each diatom genome. Less than 5\% of genes within these core clusters displayed the same transcriptional responses across species when growth was limited by nitrate availability. Orthologs, such as those involved in nitrogen uptake and assimilation, as well as carbon metabolism, were differently expressed across the three species. The two pennate diatoms, F. cylindrus and P. multiseries, shared 3839 clusters without orthologs in the genome of the centric diatom T. pseudonana. A majority of these pennate-clustered genes, as well as the non-orthologous genes in each species, had minimal annotation information, but were often significantly differentially expressed under nitrate limitation, indicating their potential importance in the response to nitrogen availability. Despite these variations in the specific transcriptional response of each diatom, overall transcriptional patterns suggested that all three diatoms displayed a common physiological response to nitrate limitation that consisted of a general reduction in carbon fixation and carbohydrate and fatty acid metabolism and an increase in nitrogen recycling. Characterization of these finely tuned responses will help to better predict which types of diatoms will bloom under which sets of environmental factors.},

	abstract = {Organisms within all domains of life require the cofactor cobalamin (vitamin B12), which is produced only by a subset of bacteria and archaea. On the basis of genomic analyses, cobalamin biosynthesis in marine systems has been inferred in three main groups: select heterotrophic Proteobacteria, chemoautotrophic Thaumarchaeota, and photoautotrophic Cyanobacteria. Culture work demonstrates that many Cyanobacteria do not synthesize cobalamin but rather produce pseudocobalamin, challenging the connection between the occurrence of cobalamin biosynthesis genes and production of the compound in marine ecosystems. Here we show that cobalamin and pseudocobalamin coexist in the surface ocean, have distinct microbial sources, and support different enzymatic demands. Even in the presence of cobalamin, Cyanobacteria synthesize pseudocobalamin—likely reflecting their retention of an oxygen-independent pathway to produce pseudocobalamin, which is used as a cofactor in their specialized methionine synthase (MetH). This contrasts a model diatom, Thalassiosira pseudonana, which transported pseudocobalamin into the cell but was unable to use pseudocobalamin in its homolog of MetH. Our genomic and culture analyses showed that marine Thaumarchaeota and select heterotrophic bacteria produce cobalamin. This indicates that cobalamin in the surface ocean is a result of de novo synthesis by heterotrophic bacteria or via modification of closely related compounds like cyanobacterially produced pseudocobalamin. Deeper in the water column, our study implicates Thaumarchaeota as major producers of cobalamin based on genomic potential, cobalamin cell quotas, and abundance. Together, these findings establish the distinctive roles played by abundant prokaryotes in cobalamin-based microbial interdependencies that sustain community structure and function in the ocean.},

More numerous than the stars in the universe, these organisms serve as the foundation of all marine food webs, recycling major elements and producing and consuming about half the organic matter generated on Earth each year (1). In this issue, five research articles from the Tara Oceans expedition (2–6) provide a vivid, potentially transformative view of the genetic diversity and interconnectivity of these unseen marine communities of viruses, bacteria, archaea, single-celled eukaryotes, and small planktonic animals (see the figure). Together, these studies deliver compelling evidence for extensive networks of previously hidden biological interactions in the sea.},

Metagenomes provide a fragmented view of such communities, but the ecosystem functions of major groups of organisms remain mysterious. To better characterize members of these communities, we developed methods to reconstruct genomes directly from mate-paired short-read metagenomes. We closed a genome representing the as-yet uncultured marine group II Euryarchaeota, assembled de novo from 1.7\% of a metagenome sequenced from surface seawater. The genome describes a motile, photo-heterotrophic cell focused on degradation of protein and lipids and clarifies the origin of proteorhodopsin. It also demonstrates that high-coverage mate-paired sequence can overcome assembly difficulties caused by interstrain variation in complex microbial communities, enabling inference of ecosystem functions for uncultured members.},

	abstract = {In terrestrial ecosystems, transitional areas between different plant communities (ecotones) are formed by steep environmental gradients and are commonly characterized by high species diversity and primary productivity, which in turn influences the foodweb structure of these regions. Whether comparable zones of elevated diversity and productivity characterize ecotones in the oceans remains poorly understood. Here we describe a previously hidden hotspot of phytoplankton diversity and productivity in a narrow but seasonally persistent transition zone at the intersection of iron-poor, nitrate-rich offshore waters and iron-rich, nitrate-poor coastal waters of the Northeast Pacific Ocean. Novel continuous measurements of phytoplankton cell abundance and composition identified a complex succession of blooms of five distinct size classes of phytoplankton populations within a 100-km–wide transition zone. The blooms appear to be fueled by natural iron enrichment of offshore communities as they are transported toward the coast. The observed succession of phytoplankton populations is likely driven by spatial gradients in iron availability or time since iron enrichment. Regardless of the underlying mechanism, the resulting communities have a strong impact on the regional biogeochemistry as evidenced by the low partial pressure of CO2 and the nearly complete depletion of nutrients. Enhanced phytoplankton productivity and diversity associated with steep environmental gradients are expected wherever water masses with complementary nutrient compositions mix to create a region more favorable for phytoplankton growth. The ability to detect and track these important but poorly characterized marine ecotones is critical for understanding their impact on productivity and ecosystem structure in the oceans.},

The database also incorporates links to the recently sequenced genomes of P. tricornutum and T. pseudonana, enabling an easy cross-talk between the expression pattern of diatom orthologs and the genome browsers.

We applied single-virus and single-cell infection approaches to quantify cyanophage abundance and infected picocyanobacteria in 87 surface water samples from five transects that traversed approximately 2,200 km in the North Pacific Ocean on three cruises, with a duration of 2–4 weeks, between 2015 and 2017. We detected a 550-km-wide hotspot of cyanophages and virus-infected picocyanobacteria in the transition zone between the North Pacific Subtropical and Subpolar gyres that was present in each transect. Notably, the hotspot occurred at a consistent temperature and displayed distinct cyanophage-lineage composition on all transects. On two of these transects, the levels of infection in the hotspot were estimated to be sufficient to substantially limit the geographical range of Prochlorococcus. Coincident with the detection of high levels of virally infected picocyanobacteria, we measured an increase of 10–100-fold in the Synechococcus populations in samples that are usually dominated by Prochlorococcus. We developed a multiple regression model of cyanophages, temperature and chlorophyll concentrations that inferred that the hotspot extended across the North Pacific Ocean, creating a biological boundary between gyres, with the potential to release organic matter comparable to that of the sevenfold-larger North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. Our results highlight the probable impact of viruses on large-scale phytoplankton biogeography and biogeochemistry in distinct regions of the oceans.},

	abstract = {Formation of complex inorganic structures is widespread in nature. Diatoms create intricately patterned cell walls of inorganic silicon that are a biomimetic model for design and generation of three-dimensional silica nanostructures. To date, only relatively simple silica structures can be generated in vitro through manipulation of known diatom phosphoproteins (silaffins) and long-chain polyamines. Here, we report the use of genome-wide transcriptome analyses of the marine diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana to identify additional candidate gene products involved in the biological manipulation of silicon. Whole-genome oligonucleotide tiling arrays and tandem mass spectrometry identified transcripts for {\textgreater}8,000 genes, ≈3,000 of which were not previously described and included noncoding and antisense RNAs. Gene-specific expression profiles detected a set of 75 genes induced only under low concentrations of silicon but not under low concentrations of nitrogen or iron, alkaline pH, or low temperatures. Most of these induced gene products were predicted to contain secretory signals and/or transmembrane domains but displayed no homology to known proteins. Over half of these genes were newly discovered, identified only through the use of tiling arrays. Unexpectedly, a common set of 84 genes were induced by both silicon and iron limitations, suggesting that biological manipulation of silicon may share pathways in common with iron or, alternatively, that iron may serve as a required cofactor for silicon processes. These results provide insights into the transcriptional and translational basis for the biological generation of elaborate silicon nanostructures by these ecologically important microbes.},

Meiotic progeny thus inherit chloroplast DNA almost exclusively from the mating-type plus parent. The plus-linked nuclear mutation mat3 prevents this selective destruction of minus chloroplast DNA and generates progeny that display a biparental inheritance pattern. Here we show that the mat3 mutation creates additional phenotypes not previously described: the cells are much smaller than wild type and they possess substantially reduced amounts of both mitochondrial and chloroplast DNA. We propose that the primary defect of the mat3 mutation is a disruption of cell-size control and that the inhibition of the uniparental transmission of chloroplast genomes is a secondary consequence of the reduced amount of chloroplast DNA in the mat3 parent.},

	abstract = {Mesoscale eddies have been shown to support elevated dinitrogen (N2) fixation rates (NFRs) and abundances of N2-fixing microorganisms (diazotrophs), but the mechanisms underlying these observations are not well understood. We sampled two pairs of mesoscale cyclones and anticyclones in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre in 2017 and 2018 and compared our observations with seasonal patterns from the Hawaii Ocean Time-series (HOT) program. Consistent with previous reports, we found that NFRs were anomalously high for this region (up to 3.7-fold above previous monthly HOT observations) in the centers of both sampled anticyclones. In 2017, these elevated rates coincided with high concentrations of the diazotroph Crocosphaera. We then coupled our field-based observations, together with transcriptomic analyses of nutrient stress marker genes and ecological models, to evaluate the role of biological (via estimates of growth and grazing rates) and physical controls on populations of Crocosphaera, Trichodesmium, and diatom symbionts at the mesoscale. Our results suggest that increased Crocosphaera abundances in the 2017 anticyclone resulted from the alleviation of phosphate limitation, allowing cells to grow at rates exceeding grazing losses. In contrast, distributions of larger, buoyant taxa (Trichodesmium and diatom symbionts) appeared less affected by eddy-driven biological controls. Instead, they appeared driven by physical dynamics along frontal boundaries that separate cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies. No examined controls were able to explain our 2018 findings of higher NFRs in the anticyclone. A generalized explanation of elevated NFRs in mesoscale eddies remains challenging due to the interplay of eddy-driven bottom-up, top-down, and physical control mechanisms.},

Despite their importance as a component of the iron-binding ligand pool in seawater, data on the distribution of siderophores and the microbes that use them are limited. Here, we measured the concentrations and types of dissolved siderophores during two cruises in April 2016 and June 2017 that transited from the iron-replete, low-macronutrient North Pacific Subtropical Gyre through the North Pacific Transition Zone (NPTZ) to the iron-deplete, high-macronutrient North Pacific Subarctic Frontal Zone (SAFZ). Surface siderophore concentrations in 2017 were higher in the NPTZ (4.0–13.9 pM) than the SAFZ (1.2–5.1 pM), which may be partly attributed to stimulated siderophore production by environmental factors such as dust-derived iron concentrations (up to 0.51 nM). Multiple types of siderophores were identified on both cruises, including ferrioxamines, amphibactins, and iron-free forms of photoreactive siderophores, which suggest active production and use of diverse siderophores across latitude and depth. Siderophore biosynthesis and uptake genes and transcripts were widespread across latitude, and higher abundances of these genes and transcripts at higher latitudes may reflect active siderophore-mediated iron uptake by the local bacterial community across the North Pacific. The variability in the taxonomic composition of bacterial communities that transcribe putative ferrioxamine, amphibactin, and salmochelin transporter genes at different latitudes further suggests that the microbial groups involved in active siderophore production and usage change depending on local conditions.},

Here, we show that the two clades of flavodoxins present within diatoms exhibit a functional divergence, with only clade II flavodoxins displaying the canonical role in acclimation to iron limitation. We created CRISPR/Cas9 knock-outs of the clade I flavodoxin from the model diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana and found that these cell lines are hypersensitive to oxidative stress, while maintaining a wild-type response to iron limitation. Within natural diatom communities, clade I flavodoxin transcript abundance is regulated over the diel cycle rather than in response to iron availability, whereas clade II transcript abundances increase either in iron-limiting regions or under artificially induced iron limitation. The observed functional specialization of two flavodoxin variants within diatoms reiterates two major stressors associated with contemporary oceans and illustrates diatom strategies to flourish in diverse aquatic ecosystems.},

This tight coupling raises the question: which top-down drivers predominate in maintaining persistently stable picocyanobacterial populations over longer time scales? Motivated by high-frequency surface water measurements taken in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG), we developed multitrophic models to investigate bottom-up and top-down mechanisms underlying the balanced control of Prochlorococcus populations. We find that incorporating photosynthetic growth with viral- and predator-induced mortality is sufficient to recapitulate daily oscillations of Prochlorococcus abundances with baseline community abundances. In doing so, we infer that grazers in this environment function as the predominant top-down factor despite high standing viral particle densities. The model-data fits also reveal the ecological relevance of light-dependent viral traits and non-canonical factors to cellular loss. Finally, we leverage sensitivity analyses to demonstrate how variation in life history traits across distinct oceanic contexts, including variation in viral adsorption and grazer clearance rates, can transform the quantitative and even qualitative importance of top-down controls in shaping Prochlorococcus population dynamics.},

Here, we focus on the North East Pacific Transition Zone, a 10° region of latitude straddling warm, nutrient-poor subtropical and cold, nutrient-rich subpolar gyres. Data from three cruises to the region revealed intricate patterns of phytoplankton community structure: poleward increases in the number of cell size classes; increasing biomass of picoeukaryotes and diatoms; decreases in diazotrophs and Prochlorococcus; and both increases and decreases in Synechococcus. These patterns can only be partially explained by existing theories. Using data, theory, and numerical simulations, we show that the patterns of plankton distributions across the transition zone are the result of gradients in nutrient supply rates, which control a range of complex biotic interactions. We examine how interactions such as size-specific grazing, multiple trophic strategies, shared grazing between several phytoplankton size classes and heterotrophic bacteria, and competition for multiple resources can individually explain aspects of the observed community structure. However, it is the combination of all these interactions together that is needed to explain the bulk compositional patterns in phytoplankton across the North East Pacific Transition Zone. The synthesis of multiple mechanisms is essential for us to begin to understand the shaping of community structure over large environmental gradients.},

	abstract = {The Hawaii Ocean Time-series (HOT) at Station ALOHA (22.75°N, 158°W) in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG) serves as a critical vantage point for observing plankton biomass production and its ecological implications. However, the HOT program's near-monthly sampling frequency does not capture shorter time scale variability in phytoplankton populations. To address this gap, we deployed the SeaFlow flow cytometer for continuous monitoring during HOT cruises from 2014 to 2021. This approach allowed us to examine variations in the surface abundance and cell carbon content of specific phytoplankton groups: the cyanobacteria Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus, and Crocosphaera as well as a range of small eukaryotic phytoplankton (≤{\textbackslash} łe {\textbackslash} 5 μm). Our data showed that daily to monthly variability in Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus abundance matches seasonal and interannual variability, while small eukaryotic phytoplankton and Crocosphaera showed the highest seasonal and interannual fluctuations. The study also found that eukaryotic phytoplankton and Crocosphaera had higher median cellular growth rates (0.076 and 0.090h−1{\textbackslash} 0.090{\textbackslash}kern0.5em {\textbackslash}mathrmh{\textasciicircum}-1 {\textbackslash}, respectively) compared to Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus (0.037 and 0.045h−1{\textbackslash} 0.045{\textbackslash}kern0.5em {\textbackslash}mathrmh{\textasciicircum}-1 {\textbackslash}, respectively). These variances in abundance and growth rates indicate that shifts in the community structure significantly impact primary productivity in the NPSG. Our results underscore the importance of daily to monthly phytoplankton dynamics in ecosystem function and carbon cycling.},
